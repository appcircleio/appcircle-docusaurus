## Technical Implementation Success Factors

### 1. Smart Term Extraction
```python
# Preserves technical terminology
"PAT setup" ‚Üí ["PAT", "setup"]  # ‚úÖ Keeps abbreviation
"iOS build" ‚Üí ["iOS", "build"]  # ‚úÖ Preserves platform
"CI/CD pipeline" ‚Üí ["CI", "CD", "pipeline"]  # ‚úÖ Handles compounds
```

### 2. Hybrid Scoring Algorithm
```python
priority_score = (
    semantic_similarity * 0.3 +      # Still important for relevance
    exact_term_bonus * 0.25 +        # High value for exact matches  
    coverage_bonus * 0.3 +           # Reward high term coverage
    phrase_bonus * 0.3               # Extra points for full phrases
)
```
