## [Testing Groups](/testing-distribution/testing-groups)

The testing group feature is used to manage and organize testers. Different versions of applications can be distributed to specific groups based on testing needs, such as OS versions, features, devices, and more.

## [Re-sign Binaries](/testing-distribution/resigning-binaries)

Re-signing is the process of modifying an existing binary with a new signing certificate or keystore, required when an application needs to be published under a different developer account or when updating an existing application. This process involves removing the original signature and replacing it with a new one.
