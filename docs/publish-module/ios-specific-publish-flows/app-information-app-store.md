# App Information from App Store

This step allows you to see app version information from [**TestFlight**](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) and the [**App Store**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/app_store) on the same screen, along with the version you want to submit. When the step runs, your latest version information in TestFlight and the App Store will be displayed as follows:

:::info
You can find brief descriptions of some of the information we provide on the App Information screen below.

- **`Bundle ID`**: The `bundleIds` resource represents the app's unique identifier that you can register, modify, and delete. For further information, please check [**Apple's documentation**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids).
- **`App Icon`**: Specifies the icon that will appear for the app on the selected platform. For further information, please check the [**Apple App Icon documentation**](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons).
- **`App Name`**: The display name of the application on the selected platform.
- **`Version`**: The current available app versions. For example, `1.0.5`.
- **`Build Number`**: Version code information of your application. For example, `1.0.5(1)`.
- **`Uploaded Date`**: Date the application was first uploaded. The **Release Candidate** version is based on the date it was uploaded to the **Publish module**.
- **`Expire Date`**: It is the expiration date of the application version in TestFlight and the App Store. There is no expiration date in the **Release Candidate** version.Â 
- **`Release Type`**: Indicates the release type of your application. For example, if you have an application released to the market, you will see the type as **After Approval**.
- **`Processing State`**: The processing state shows the status of your application; you will see it as **`Valid`** when there is no problem. For example, if your application has expired in the TestFlight environment, you will see the state as **`Expire`**. Or if the application is rejected, the state is **`Reject`**.
