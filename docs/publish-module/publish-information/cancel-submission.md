# Cancel Submission

With Appcircle's **Cancel Submission** feature, you can cancel your submitted version on **App Store Connect**. With this feature, you can easily withdraw the relevant version from the review without going to App Store Connect.

:::caution Cancel Submission

This feature is only active for versions with a status of **Waiting for Review** or **In Review** on App Store Connect. If the version does not have one of these statuses, the feature will appear disabled.
