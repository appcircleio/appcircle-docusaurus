## Release Notes

Release Notes are an important part of the binary information, providing context and details about what is included in each version of the application. These notes are shared with the users or testers and often contain information about new features, bug fixes, and other updates.

### Adding Release Notes

Before publishing your binary to the app stores, you can add Release Notes in the Publish module:

1. **Access Binary Information:**

   - Navigate to the 'Binary Information' section for the selected app version in the Publish module.

2. **Input Release Notes:**

   - Click on the text field under 'Release Notes' to type in your message.
   - Detail the key points that users should know about the new app version, such as new features, improvements, or issues resolved.

3. **Save Release Notes:**
   - Once you have entered the release notes, save your changes.
   - These notes will accompany the binary when it is published, so ensure they are clear and concise.

### Best Practices for Release Notes:

- **Be Clear:** Write in a simple, direct language so that all users can understand the changes.
- **Be Concise:** Keep the notes brief but informative â€” avoid overwhelming the user with too much information.
- **Highlight Important Changes:** Clearly state any major new features, bug fixes, or any changes that affect user interactions.
- **Localization:** If your app supports multiple languages, consider localizing the release notes for each supported language.

Release Notes are an essential tool for communication with your users. They can significantly impact the user's perception and adoption of new updates. Always include them as part of your publishing process.

:::caution Release Notes Character Limit on TestFlight
When submitting updates through TestFlight, the "What to Test" section has a 4,000-character limit. If your release notes exceed this limit, Apple will automatically trim the message to fit. Please ensure your notes are within this limit to avoid any important information being cut off.
