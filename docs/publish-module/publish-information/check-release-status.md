# Check Release Status

Appcircle performs status checks for your published applications. This status gives you information about the status of the relevant version on the market. You can find detailed information about Appcircle's status feature in the documentation [**here**](/publish-module/binary-management#store-status).

Appcircle updates a published app for status updates **every 30 minutes** if the app is [**Marked as RC**](/publish-module/publish-information/marking-release-candidates). However, the user can also do this manually.

:::caution Check Release Status Manually

This feature is currently only available for **iOS profiles**. It will be available for Android profiles as soon as possible.

With the Check Release Status function, you can instantly update the status information of the version marked as Release Candidate.
