The History section has two parts: The Publish History and The Resign History.

The Publish History section is a record of all the publishing actions that have been performed for different versions of an application. It serves as a log for tracking the deployment lifecycle of each release.

The Resign History section is a record of all the resign actions that have been performed within the Publish module for a specific app version.

## Overview

Once you select the History section you can access both the Publish History and the Resign History.

You can access the Publish History to gain insight into the sequence of events for each published version. It is an invaluable tool for auditing, troubleshooting, and understanding the timeline of version deployments.

Build History will provide the original build logs from the build profile that was distributed to the selected publish profile.

You can also access the Resign History for an app version by navigating to it's tab to monitor the resign actions for that specific version.

### Accessing Publish History
