# Downloading Binaries

The "Download" function in the Publish module allows you to easily download the built application files, such as IPA for iOS or APK/AAB for Android, directly to your local system.

## Steps to Download Your Binary

1. **Navigate to the Desired Version:**

   - In the Publish module, locate the version of the app that you want to download.

2. **Open the Options Menu:**

   - Click on the three dots (menu icon) next to the version to see more options.

3. **Select 'Download':**

   - From the dropdown menu, choose the "Download" option.

4. **Save the File:**

   - Your browser will prompt you to save the file. Choose a destination on your local machine and confirm to start the download.

5. **Verification (Optional):**
   - After the download is complete, it is recommended to verify the integrity of the file, which can be done by checking the checksum, if available.

## Use Cases for Downloading Binaries

- **Local Testing:** Quickly grab a build for local testing or sharing with testers who may not have access to the Publish module.
- **Backup:** Keep a local backup of certain builds for record-keeping or rollback purposes.
- **Distribution:** Manually distribute the build to other services or stakeholders as needed.

Please note that the availability of binaries for download might depend on the retention policy set within the Publish module or the build's life cycle management rules. Make sure to download the binaries you need before they are auto-purged if such a policy is in place.
