### Mark Version as Release Candidate

Appcircle allows you to mark your app version as RC and designate any version as a **Release Candidate** with ease by simply selecting the desired app version and clicking on the **Mark as RC** button.

:::caution
In order to execute a flow, it must be marked as a Release Candidate (RC). If it is not marked as RC, it cannot be executed.

The chosen version will be visibly distinguished, allowing users to easily identify it as a `Release Candidate`.

:::tip

If you configure an app version with `Auto Publish=On` in its build configurations within the build module before distribution to the Publish profile, Appcircle will automatically mark the app version as a `Release Candidate` and execute the Publish Flow operation directly.

Please note that this is valid for auto-published app versions. Any app version that was uploaded manually via UI or API can not be marked as `Release Candidate` automatically.
