## 1. Publish Details

This option provides an in-depth view of the selected version's publish process. Users can review the steps taken, configurations used, and outcomes of the publish sequence. It's an essential resource for understanding the specific details of a version's journey through the publish workflow.

## 3. Marking Release Candidates

This action is used to change the status of a build that has been previously marked as a Release Candidate (RC). This might be necessary if the build is found to have issues that require it to be retracted from the release candidate status, indicating it's not yet ready for production release.

## 4. Downloading Binaries

This functionality enables users to download the binary directly from the Publish module. This is useful for offline review, storage, or distribution purposes. The download feature ensures that users can access and disseminate the application's build even outside the publish platform.
