## Publish Details

This option provides an in-depth view of the selected version's publish process. Users can review the steps taken, configurations used, and outcomes of the publish sequence. It's an essential resource for understanding the specific details of a version's journey through the publish workflow.

## Meta Data Information

The Meta Data Information option provides a comprehensive overview of the version's metadata. This includes details such as the application name, version, build number, and other relevant information. Users can review and edit metadata to ensure accurate and consistent versioning across the application.

## Resign Binary

The Resign Binary feature allows users to resign both iOS and Android application binaries. For iOS applications, users can change provisioning profiles or app entitlements, while for Android applications, users can resign binaries with a new keystore. This feature is essential for updating app distribution settings and security credentials without requiring a new build.

## Marking Release Candidates

This action is used to change the status of a build that has been previously marked as a Release Candidate (RC). This might be necessary if the build is found to have issues that require it to be retracted from the release candidate status, indicating it's not yet ready for production release.

## Downloading Binaries

This functionality enables users to download the binary directly from the Publish module. This is useful for offline review, storage, or distribution purposes. The download feature ensures that users can access and disseminate the application's build even outside the publish platform.

This feature helps in maintaining a clean and organized workspace by removing obsolete or unnecessary versions.
