### Publish Flow Samples

The Publish module is designed to cater to a wide range of needs, making it suitable for both enterprise-level companies and individual developers. Here are a few examples of custom flows you might create:

#### Beta Testing and Release Flow

With the Appcircle Publish module, you can manage your entire release process from scratch without needing to access the developer interfaces of the app stores. Below is an example flow that demonstrates how to manage a release process including testing from start to finish. The steps are utilized in the following order:

- [**App Information from App Store**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/app-information-app-store): This step compares the Release Candidate version with the latest versions in both the TestFlight and Production environments, giving you an idea of how the release process will begin.
- [**Get Approval via Email**](/publish-integrations/common-publish-integrations/get-approval-via-email): After the version comparison is completed, an approval email is sent to the Release Manager to decide whether or not to proceed with the release process. This email informs the Release Manager about the release that is set to go to Beta Test. If the Release Manager sees no issues, they can click the Approve link within the email to move the process forward.
- [**Send to TestFlight**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/sent-to-testflight): With this step, the binary is uploaded to TestFlight.
- [**Get Approval from TestFlight**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/approval-test-flight): This step is presented with a UI that includes test information for the app you sent to TestFlight for beta testing. Here, you can either send the binary to a selected test group immediately or obtain approval from testers to confirm that the binary is issue-free. If the step succeeds under the selected conditions, it will proceed accordingly.
- [**Update Metadata on App Store Connect**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/update-metadata-on-app-store-connect): This step will assist you in updating metadata. It comes with a custom UI that displays previews of the metadata to be uploaded, allowing you to update metadata in the app stores for this new release. With support for localization and screenshots, you can manage metadata updates without the need for direct access the app store listing management interfaces.
- [**Get Approval via Email**](/publish-integrations/common-publish-integrations/get-approval-via-email): After receiving approval from TestFlight and uploading the metadata, you can send an approval email to the Release Manager to review the Beta Test and the updated metadata. If everything is in order, the Release Manager can approve the process, allowing the flow to continue and submit the version for release.
- [**Submit for Review on App Store**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/add-for-review-on-app-store): After receiving the final approval from the Release Manager, the binary file and the updated metadata are sent to the final step of the release process: app review. This step directly submits the version for review in the store.
