Appcircle supports publishing the application to the stores without using the Build module. To add an application version manually, you need to add a publish profile beforehand and then **Open** its details.

You can then upload the application by clicking on the **Add Version** button on the right.

When the upload is completed successfully, the relevant application version will appear in the list.

Afterwards, you can start submitting your application to the stores with the publish flow that you have configured.

For this, click on the **Actions** button for the relevant version and go to **Details**. From there, you can manually **Start Flow** for the uploaded application version.
