# Creating Publish Profiles

import Screenshot from '@site/src/components/Screenshot';

After building the application, we can start the publishing process by sending it to the Publish module.

For this, it is necessary to first create a publish profile within the Publish module. Afterwards, the relevant publish profile must be selected from the **Distribution** tab in the configuration of the relevant profile in the Build module.

In order to create a publish profile, click on the "Add New" button in the Publish module.

You should give a descriptive name to the relevant publish profile.
