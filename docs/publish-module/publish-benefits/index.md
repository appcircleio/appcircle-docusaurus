### Publish Flow Examples

The Publish module is designed to cater to a wide range of needs, making it suitable for both enterprise-level companies and individual developers. It possesses the capabilities to address diverse requirements effectively. Here are a few examples of custom flows you might create:

#### Beta Testing

Automatically send your app to TestFlight via Send to TestFlight step. This step will upload your binary file to TestFlight and allow you to send it to your test groups. For example, a flow has been created below using certain steps, allowing you to send your app to TestFlight solely for Beta testing purposes. The steps have been utilized in the following sequential order:

- [**App Information from App Store**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/app-information-app-store): This step compares the Release Candidate version with the latest versions in both the TestFlight and Production environments, giving you an idea of how the release process will begin.
- [**Get Approval via Email**](/publish-integrations/common-publish-integrations/get-approval-via-email): After the version comparison is completed, an approval email is sent to the Release Manager to decide whether or not to proceed with the release process. This email informs the Release Manager about the release that is set to go to Beta Test. If the Release Manager sees no issues, they can click the Approve link within the email to move the process forward.
- [**Send to TestFlight**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/sent-to-testflight): With this step, the binary is sent to TestFlight.
- [**Get Approval from TestFlight**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/approval-test-flight): This step is presented with a UI that includes test information for the app you sent to TestFlight for beta testing. Here, you can either send the binary to a selected test group immediately or obtain approval from testers to confirm that the binary is issue-free. If the step succeeds under the selected conditions, it will proceed with a success status.

:::caution Beta Testing

The example flow provided here is limited solely to TestFlight submission and Beta Testing purposes. With this flow, the binary is only sent to TestFlight and distributed to the relevant test groups.

#### Release Flow

Thanks to the capabilities of the Appcircle Publish module, you can manage your entire release process from scratch without needing to access the developer interfaces of the app stores. Below is an example flow that demonstrates how to manage a release process from start to finish. The steps have been utilized in the following sequential order:

- [**App Information from App Store**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/app-information-app-store): This step compares the Release Candidate version with the latest versions in both the TestFlight and Production environments, giving you an idea of how the release process will begin.
- [**Get Approval via Email**](/publish-integrations/common-publish-integrations/get-approval-via-email): After the version comparison is completed, an approval email is sent to the Release Manager to decide whether or not to proceed with the release process. This email informs the Release Manager about the release that is set to go to Beta Test. If the Release Manager sees no issues, they can click the Approve link within the email to move the process forward.
- [**Send to TestFlight**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/sent-to-testflight): With this step, the binary is sent to TestFlight.
- [**Get Approval from TestFlight**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/approval-test-flight): This step is presented with a UI that includes test information for the app you sent to TestFlight for beta testing. Here, you can either send the binary to a selected test group immediately or obtain approval from testers to confirm that the binary is issue-free. If the step succeeds under the selected conditions, it will proceed with a success status.
- [**Update Metadata on App Store Connect**](/publish-integrations/ios-publish-integrations/update-metadata-on-app-store-connect): This step will assist you in updating metadata. It comes with a custom UI that displays previews of the metadata to be uploaded, allowing you to upload your most recently updated metadata to the app stores. With support for localization and screenshots, you can manage this process without needing to access the developer interfaces.
