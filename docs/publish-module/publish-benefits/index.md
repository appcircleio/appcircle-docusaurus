## Getting Started

The Publish module in Appcircle is a versatile tool that simplifies the app release process. To make the most of this module, it's important to ensure that you meet all prerequisites and properly configure the necessary settings.

## Prerequisites for Using the Publish Module

Before you can start using the Publish module, there are several key prerequisites to address:

### App Store Integrations
- You need to have developer accounts for each app store where you intend to publish your app. This includes:

    - Apple Developer Account for the **App Store** and **TestFlight**.
    - Google Play Console Account for **Google Play**.
    - Huawei Developer Account for **Huawei AppGallery**.

- Ensure that these accounts are active, and you have the necessary credentials (API keys, client secrets, etc.) to connect them to Appcircle.

### Appcircle Project Setup

- Your mobile application should be correctly set up within the Appcircle platform. This includes having a configured project with the necessary app builds (binary files) available for release.
- If you haven't set up your project in Appcircle, follow the setup guide provided in the Appcircle documentation to ensure everything is ready for publishing.

### App Metadata Preparation

- Gather all required metadata for your app, such as:

    - App name
    - Description
    - Keywords
    - App icons and screenshots
    - Privacy policy URL
    - Contact information

- Having this information prepared in advance will streamline the publishing process.

### Store Integration Permissions

- Ensure that your developer accounts have the necessary permissions to publish apps, manage metadata, and access analytics. If you're part of a team, verify that you have the appropriate role within your developer account (e.g., Admin, Release Manager).
