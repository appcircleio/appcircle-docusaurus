:::danger Enable "Always Run" Toggle

Please make sure the **"Always run this step even if the previous steps fail"** toggle is enabled.

**Why this is important:**
When a test fails in an earlier step, the workflow normally stops immediately. By enabling this toggle, this step will continue to run even after test failures, ensuring you always receive your test results and reports, whether tests pass or fail.
