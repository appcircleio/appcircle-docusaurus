### Configure Plugin

After adding the plugin to your build steps, ensure that you provide all required inputs.
Additionally, remember to place the plugin after your build steps as you will need to specify the build path later on.

### Using Plugin into Your Script

```Groovy
   stage('Publish') {
      environment {
         AC_PAT = credentials('AC_PAT')
      }
       steps {
          appcircleEnterpriseAppStore personalAPIToken: AC_PAT,
                  appPath: '$APP_PATH',
                  releaseNotes: '$RELEASE_NOTE',
                  summary: '$SUMMARY',
                  publishType: '$PUBLISH_TYPE' // "0": None, "1": Beta, "2": Live
       }
   }
```

- `personalAPIToken`: The Appcircle Personal API token is utilized to authenticate and secure access to Appcircle services, ensuring that only authorized users can perform actions within the platform.
- `appPath`: Indicates the file path to the application package that will be uploaded to Appcircle Enterprise App Store Profile.
- `releaseNotes`: Contains the details of changes, updates, and improvements made in the current version of the app being published.
- `summary`: Used to provide a brief overview of the version of the app that is about to be published.
- `publishType`: Specifies the publishing status as either none, beta, or live, and must be assigned the values "0", "1", or "2" accordingly.

:::caution Build Steps Order
Ensure that this action is added after build steps have been completed.

:::

:::caution
If two workflows start simultaneously, the last workflow to reach the publish step will be the up-to-date version on the Enterprise App Store. If these workflows building the same package version, the first publish will be successful, while later deployments with the same version will fail.
