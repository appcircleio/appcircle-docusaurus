In order to install Appcircle Enterprise App Store task extension, follow these steps;

1. Go to your pipeline, click "Edit" button on the top right corner

2. Inside your YAML file, search for "Appcircle Enterprise App Store" task extension
   <Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-242_azure_ent_store_task.png' />
3. Complete the necessary input fields and then click the "Add" button.

   3.1. You can learn more about getting your personal api token [here](/appcircle-api-and-cli/api-authentication#generatingmanaging-the-personal-api-tokens).

After filling out the required fields, the `AppcircleEnterpriseStore@0` task will appear in your pipeline steps as shown below:

```yaml
- task: AppcircleEnterpriseStore@0
  inputs:
    personalAPIToken: $(AC_PERSONAL_API_TOKEN)
    appPath: $(APP_PATH)
    summary: $(SUMMARY)
    releaseNotes: $(RELEASE_NOTES)
    publishType: $(PUBLISH_TYPE)
```

- `personalAPIToken`: The Appcircle Personal API token is utilized to
  authenticate and secure access to Appcircle services, ensuring that only
  authorized users can perform actions within the platform.
- `appPath`: Indicates the file path to the application that will be uploaded to
  Appcircle Enterprise App Store Profile.
- `releaseNote`: Contains the details of changes, updates, and improvements made
  in the current version of the app being published.
- `Summary`: Used to provide a brief overview of the version of the app that is
  about to be published.
- `publishType`: Specifies the publishing status as either none, beta, or live,
  and must be assigned the values "None", "Beta", or "Live" accordingly.

### Leveraging Environment Variables

Utilize environment variables seamlessly by substituting the parameters with $(VARIABLE_NAME) in your task inputs. The extension automatically retrieves values from the specified environment variables within your pipeline.

:::caution Build Steps Order
Ensure that this action is added after build steps have been completed.
:::

:::caution
If two workflows start simultaneously, the last workflow to reach the publish step will be the up-to-date version on the Enterprise App Store. If these workflows building the same package version, the first publish will be successful, while later deployments with the same version will fail.
