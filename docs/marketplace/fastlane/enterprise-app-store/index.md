:::

### Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `appcircle_enterprise_app_store`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin appcircle_enterprise_app_store
```

After adding the plugin to your project, configure your Fastfile as follows:

```ruby
  lane :distribute_app_store do
    appcircle_enterprise_app_store(
      personalAPIToken: "$(AC_PERSONAL_API_TOKEN)",
      appPath: "$(APP_PATH)",
      summary: "$(SUMMARY)",
      releaseNotes: "$(RELEASE_NOTE)",
      publishType: "$(PUBLISH_TYPE)" # Assign the appropriate number based on the status: None (0), Beta (1), Live (2)
    )
  end
```

- `personalAPIToken`: The Appcircle Personal API token is utilized to authenticate and secure access to Appcircle services, ensuring that only authorized users can perform actions within the platform.
- `appPath`: Indicates the file path to the application package that will be uploaded to Appcircle Testing Distribution Profile.
- `releaseNotes`: Contains the details of changes, updates, and improvements made in the current version of the app being published.
- `summary`: Used to provide a brief overview of the version of the app that is about to be published.
- `publishType`: Specifies the publishing status as either none, beta, or live, and must be assigned the values "0", "1", or "2" accordingly.

### Leveraging Environment Variables

Utilize environment variables seamlessly by substituting the parameters with `$(VARIABLE_NAME)` in your task inputs. The extension automatically retrieves values from the specified environment variables within your pipeline.

:::caution Build Steps Order
Ensure that this action is added after build steps have been completed.

:::

:::caution
If two workflows start simultaneously, the last workflow to reach the publish step will be the up-to-date version on the Enterprise App Store. If these workflows building the same package version, the first publish will be successful, while later deployments with the same version will fail.
