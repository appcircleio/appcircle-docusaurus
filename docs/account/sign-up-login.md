# Sign Up / Login

## Signing Up

Getting started with Appcircle is easy. To sign up for Appcircle, go to [https://my.appcircle.io](https://my.appcircle.io) and either:

Click on a login provider and follow the permission prompts displayed by the provider. For login, Appcircle does not ask for any additional permissions other than the email address. You won't be required to verify your email address.

Or click on the **Sign up with e-mail** link and fill in the required information. Email verification is required if you sign up with email. Follow the instructions sent to your email address to complete the registration.

## Logging In

To log in, go to [https://my.appcircle.io](https://my.appcircle.io) and either click on a linked login provider for one-click login or type in your email address and password and click **Log in**.

If you forget your password, you can request a new one by clicking on the **Forgot Password** link and entering your email address.

### Linking a New Login Provider from Login

If the selected account from a login provider has an email address that already exists in Appcircle, you will be prompted to link this account with the current one. When you press the **Add to existing account **button, an email will be sent to the email address to confirm the account linking.
