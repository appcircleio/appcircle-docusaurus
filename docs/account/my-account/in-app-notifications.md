# In-app Notifications

In-app notifications in Appcircle keep you informed about important actions within the platform. You can easily view and filter the in-app notifications from the notifications window in the bottom-right corner to stay updated.

Next to the notifications icon, you can see the current number of notifications and unread notifications, displayed as **unread / total**.
