# Account Management

In the Account Management section, you have comprehensive control over your account's security and personal information settings.

## [Device Activity](/account-and-organization/my-account/account-management/device-activity)

View and manage all active sessions to understand where your account is currently logged in.

## [Signing In](/account-and-organization/my-account/account-management/signing-in)

Secure your account by regularly updating your password through this option. Also, enhance account security by setting up two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of protection.

## [Delete Account](/account-and-organization/my-account/account-management/delete-account)

If you need to, you can initiate the process to permanently delete your account from here.

Each section provides the necessary tools to ensure your account remains secure, and is tailored to your preferences.
