# Webhooks Configuration

Appcircle will notify external services via webhooks when a certain event occurs. When the events you specified happen, we'll send a POST request in JSON format to the URLs you
provide.

### Creating Webhook

Multiple webhooks can be created for different events and build profiles. To start, go to [My Organization](/account/my-organization) Integration screen and press the **Manage** button next to Webhook under the ** Connections** section.

- Fill in the details of your webhook

**Webhook Scope:**

Type of events that you want to be notified. The following scopes are supported

- Build
- Signing Identity
- Distribution
- Store Submit
- Enterprise App Store

Each scope has different events. You can select the events you want to get notified about. For example for the Build scope, you may get the following events

- Build Started
- Build Successful
- Build Failed
- Build Canceled
- Build Timeout
- Fetch Started

**Profile:**

Some scopes support getting events for the selected build profile. You can choose the build profile from the list to get notified for that specific build profile.

**Payload URL:**

Appcircle will post events to this URL. It is highly recommended to choose the HTTPS URL.

**Secret:**

To verify that a Webhook post is coming from Appcircle, you may use this secret to verify the message body. **HMAC-SHA256** of payload with your secret key should be the same as the hexadecimal signature you get in the `ac_signature` header

For example, if you used **test** as your secret and Appcircle sends you a webhook with following body,

```
{"deliveryId":"ee81f55b-fd14-4f95-9e1f-f5bce3ad29e4","timestamp":"2022-10-26T14:55:08.4622757+00:00","action":"Build|BuildStart","message":"Build started for the develop branch for the profile pr_mr_tag_test https://my.appcircle.io/build/detail/7f17fdb4-46e7-40c3-a01d-1ef18de06890","title":"Build Started","item":{"id":"9e3c7dcd-d292-4144-9844-ca07df6a8924","agentId":"4026b6f2-d298-4b54-aa31-64726ad076fc","organizationId":"6fbd094c-18cb-4bcd-bc6f-cf2aee752982","userId":"6320a79e-d1f0-45d0-a38e-920dc4c30644","profileId":"7f17fdb4-46e7-40c3-a01d-1ef18de06890","branchId":"3779c7d2-c826-4596-95f2-52486bf75471","buildId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","commitId":"ba50d2d6-bfcc-49a1-8fa6-6e00711b4d5b","taskId":"9e3c7dcd-d292-4144-9844-ca07df6a8924","purpose":1,"triggerReason":0,"cancelling":false,"queueItemStatus":1,"xcodeVersion":""},"links":{"detail":"https://my.appcircle.io/build/detail/7f17fdb4-46e7-40c3-a01d-1ef18de06890","viewlogs":"https://my.appcircle.io/build/detail/7f17fdb4-46e7-40c3-a01d-1ef18de06890?modal=/build/modal/Logs&profileId=7f17fdb4-46e7-40c3-a01d-1ef18de06890&commitId=ba50d2d6-bfcc-49a1-8fa6-6e00711b4d5b&buildId=9e3c7dcd-d292-4144-9844-ca07df6a8924&scope=build&method=get"}}
```

Calculating HMAC-256 of this payload with **test** should give you

`8470172a1c60447abd7dce97227448da2b369b17d54d128306625979eca6476b` This value must be the same as the value of `ac_signature` header of the request.

You may also check the `timestamp` of the payload to prevent replay attacks. You may give 5-10 minutes of a threshold for the timestamp for late webhook deliveries.

### Request History

You can check all the webhooks Appcircle sends to your endpoint by clicking the... button and then clicking the **Request History** section.
