### Organization Name and ID Management

When you create an account, an individual organization for you is created by default with your email address.

In the left column under the organization management screen, you can change your organization name, which is a descriptive name, and you can change your unique organization ID, which is used for identification purposes for that specific organization.

To update these details, simply enter the new values and press _Update_.

#### Adding a Sub Organization

Appcircle's Sub-Organization feature allows you to create multiple sub-organizations from your organization, providing a way to manage different teams and projects separately. With this feature, each sub-organization is linked to the organization.

It's worth noting that sub organizations are very similar to the organization. When you are inside a sub organization, you will have access to all the features and functionality that are available in your organization. Any licenses associated with the organization will also be applicable to the sub organization.

:::caution

To use this feature, an enterprise license is required.

:::

:::info

If you add a user to the sub-organization who already exists in the main organization, all the permissions assigned to that user in the main organization will automatically extend to the sub-organization as well.

It's worth noting that sub-organizations are very similar to the organization. When you are inside a sub-organization, you will have access to all the features and functionality that are available in your organization.

:::caution

Please note that an **Enterprise License** is required to use this feature.

If you have an enterprise license, you can create sub-organizations from the organization by navigating to the "My Organization" page, clicking on the **`Create Sub Organization`** button, and entering the necessary details for the sub-organization.

Multiple sub-organizations can be created from an organization as required. This feature is particularly useful for businesses with multiple teams working on different projects, providing a way to manage each team's access to Appcircle separately. With the Sub-Organization feature, businesses can create and manage multiple sub-organizations linked to the organization, giving different teams access to the tools they need to work on their specific projects.

#### Switching Organizations

Once you create an organization or accept an organization invite, you will be switched to that organization automatically. To switch between organizations, press the quick team switching button on the bottom-left on status bar and select an organization from the menu. The currently selected one is indicated with a check mark.

Each organization is isolated from each other, and switching means that you will switch to the "workspace" of that organization.

:::info
Once you select your organization, you will only see the profiles, artifacts, and reports belonging to that organization in all modules.

You can switch between organizations at any time without any data loss.

- If you delete an organization, you will lose ALL platform data including apps, profiles, and artifacts.
