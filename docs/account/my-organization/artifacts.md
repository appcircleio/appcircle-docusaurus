# Artifacts

The **Artifacts** section allows you to manage the logs, build outputs, and cache files generated by your build profiles.

## Retention Period

Build logs and artifacts are deleted based on a retention period, which depends on your plan:

- Starter accounts can't manage the retention period. After **30** days, logs and artifacts will be automatically deleted.
- Enterprise plan organization users can manage the retention period. They can set **30**, **60**, **90**, **180** or **365** days for a retention period. Enterprise plans can also choose **never delete** option and manage their artifacts manually.

:::caution

Only build and distribution artifacts are deleted in this section. Artifacts of the Enterprise App Store and the Store Submit published applications will not be deleted.

:::

## Clean Build Caches

The Artifacts section also allows you to manually clear cached files created during the build process. This helps resolve unexpected caching issues or reduce storage usage.

Clearing the cache only removes temporary build data. It does not affect build artifacts, logs, or published applications.

:::info Permission Required

Only users with **Manager** or **Owner** roles in the organization can use the Clean Build Caches feature.

:::

:::tip Cache Limit by Plan

The build cache limit shown on the screen is determined by your subscription plan. For example:

- **Starter**: 5GB
- **Developer**: 10GB
- **Professional**: 20GB
- **Enterprise**: 30GB
- **Self-hosted**: Customizable (see the [documentation](https://docs.appcircle.io/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/advanced-configuration/cache-size-configuration))

For more detailed information on how to use **Cache Pull** and **Cache Push** in Appcircle builds, please refer to the following documentation:
- [Cache Pull](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/build-cache/cache-pull)
- [Cache Push](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/build-cache/cache-push)

Regularly clearing your build cache can help maintain a healthy and efficient build environment.
