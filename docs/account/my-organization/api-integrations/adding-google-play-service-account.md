2. **Enable** the Google Play Developer API for your Google Cloud Project. 

3. Login with your account, then head over to **Credentials -> Create Credentials**, and then click **Service account**.

## FAQ

**Can I retrieve the JSON private key that I uploaded to Appcircle?**

No, for security reasons, you cannot download the JSON file you uploaded to Appcircle.

**Why cannot I save the JSON after uploading it?**
