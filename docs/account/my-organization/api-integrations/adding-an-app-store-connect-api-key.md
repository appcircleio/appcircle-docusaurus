You can add, delete and manage iOS Certificates and Provisioning Profiles manually using Appcircle. There is also an easier way. By linking your Apple Developer account to Appcircle, you can see a list of certificates and provisioning profiles and pick the ones you want to use for building and distributing.

To link your Apple Developer account, **you need an App Store Connect API Key** from Apple's **App Store Connect Panel**.

## Login to App Store Connect

Go to [https://appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) and login with your account.

:::caution

Make sure that the correct team is selected on the top right. For developer accounts that belong to multiple teams, this is important.

:::

Once the team is correct, select **Users and Access** from the menu:

After navigating to **Users and Access**, you will see 4 tabs next to the title. Select the **Keys** tab. Then make sure that **App Store Connect API** is selected from the list on the left.

## Generating a New Key

To generate a new key, press the + button.

:::caution

Only Account Holders can enable the API Key generation. If you see a disabled **Request Access** button, contact your account holder and make them follow the steps above. After they request access, you can create new keys.

A modal popup will ask you to enter a name and add roles for this key:

:::caution

The Admin access is required to create new and download certificates or provisioning profiles. You can also give access to certain users, and on per app basis, but they require additional configuration from Apple Developer Portal.\

### Downloading the Key

After generating the key, download the key file by pressing Download API Key next to it.
