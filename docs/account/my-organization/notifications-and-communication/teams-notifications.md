# Microsoft Teams Notifications

Appcircle supports sending notifications to Microsoft Teams for the major events in all modules. You can connect Appcircle to your Microsoft Team channel to set up module-based event notifications to be sent to the selected channel.

## Adding Incoming Webhook to Microsoft Teams

In order to get notifications, the administrator of the channel should add an incoming webhook to the given channel.

- Open the channel and click ••• from the upper-right corner and then click Connectors.
