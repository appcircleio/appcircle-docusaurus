# Appcircle Bot for Slack

Appcircle is a comprehensive mobile CI/CD platform that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for mobile app development.

By adding `Appcircle Bot` to your Slack workspace, you gain the ability to perform the same actions available on [appcircle.io](https://my.appcircle.io/) directly within Slack, including:

- :package: Start a build based on your chosen profile, branch, and workflow.
- :outbox_tray: Send the selected version to your preferred test profiles or email addresses.
- :mailbox: Send the designated version to the `Submit Store` for review and distribution.

:::info

There is currently no integration of Slack available on the self-hosted Appcircle. However, we are actively working on it and it will be available for use on the self-hosted Appcircle in the near future.

### Adding Appcircle Bot to Slack

Please note that only the person who added the `Appcircle Bot` to the Slack workspace can see and manage it, and that person must be a `Workspace Owner` or a `Workspace Admin`.

To add the `Appcircle Bot` to the workspace, you can choose one of the two options below:

1. You can use the button below to add the `Appcircle Bot` to the workspace.

   <a href="https://slackbot.appcircle.io/slack/install"><img alt="Add to Slack - slack-bot-01.png" height="44" width="140" src="https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/slack-bot-01.png"/></a>

   Then, you need to allow the `Appcircle Bot` application.

2. You can use the `Slack App Directory` to add the `Appcircle Bot` to the workspace.

You will then see that Slack is connected.

### Connecting Appcircle Bot to the Account

To connect `Appcircle Bot` to your account, you need to use the `Personal Access Token` generated from your account. If you don't know how to generate it, you can follow the steps in [this document](/appcircle-api/api-authentication).

You can reach the `Enter the PAT` screen with the `Add Personal Access Token` button on the `Home` tab when the application is opened.

Enter the PAT on the mini screen that appears.

If you enter the password correctly, you will receive a confirmation message from `Appcircle Bot`.

If you want to update the PAT, you can follow the above steps for the new PAT.

### Adding Appcircle Bot to a Channel

To be able to use the `Appcircle Bot` commands, you need to add it to a channel. Commands cannot be used in private chat. Please note that anyone in the channel where you add the `Appcircle Bot` can use the app commands. If an unauthorized person adds `Appcircle Bot` to the channel, the app will leave the channel by itself.

To add `Appcircle Bot` to the channel, right-click on the app and click the `View app details`.

Click the ` + Add this app to a channel` button on the screen that appears.

### Starting a Build with Appcircle Bot

Start a new build by typing `/build` in the channel where `Appcircle Bot` has been added and pressing Enter.

On the screen that appears, select the profile you want to build.

Select a configured branch and a workflow, then start the build. Please note that selecting an unconfigured branch will result in an error.

If the selections are correct, you will receive a confirmation message from `Appcircle Bot`.

### Distributing the App to Testers

Start a new distribution to testers by typing `/distribute` in the channel where `Appcircle Bot` has been added and pressing Enter.

On the screen that appears, select the testing profile you want to distribute.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/slack-bot-8.png' />

Select a version to send, then press the `Share with Testers` button. Please note that you should not select app bundle (AAB) files because `AAB` files are only valid for Google Play submission, and they cannot be shared with testers or previewed on the device.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/slack-bot-9.png' />

On the screen that appears, fill in the following fields:

- Select one or more `testing groups` from the options. You can create a new `testing group` via [appcircle.io](https://my.appcircle.io/).
- If you want to specify the email addresses of the testers to be sent, you can add these email addresses to the `Email addresses` field by separating them with commas and spaces.
- Type your message in the `Message to Testers` field to leave a message for the testers.

After filling in the required fields, press the `Share` button.
