# Email Notifications and Subscription Management

This feature allows users with specified email addresses to be notified by email of the actions specified in Appcircle (starting a build, adding an IOS certificate, the store submission process, etc.).

:::info

Appcircle email notification can work independently for each module. For example, you can send notifications to different people for events under the Build module and to different people for store submission operations.

You can also define more than one email address for a module and send notifications. Scroll down and check out the other modules that you can tweak.
