- Check all the settings on this page and confirm that Redirect and SSO URLs are imported correctly. You can check if the X509 Certificate is imported correctly as well. If you want to enter multiple certificates you can separate them by using a comma between them. Please be aware that you need to remove any new lines or file headers from this edit box. This edit box only accepts a long base64 encoded string.

When you connect your Identity Provider, please open a new incognito window and test the SSO integration. Please only log off when you can log in with SSO credentials. If the connection doesn't work, you need to review your settings.
