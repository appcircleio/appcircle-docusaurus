# Auth0 OpenID

Appcircle supports [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) as OpenID or as SAML provider.

### Enable SSO

SSO can only be enabled by the organization's administrator. To start, go to [My Organization](/account/my-organization) screen and click the **Enable Login** button under the **APPCIRCLE LOGIN** section.

- You can now access your account with SSO integration when you confirm the email.
