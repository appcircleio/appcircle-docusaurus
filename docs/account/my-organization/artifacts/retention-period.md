The **Retention Period** feature allows you to define how long Appcircle should retain artifacts generated by different modules : **Build**, **Testing Distribution**, **Publish to Stores**, and **Enterprise App Store**.

## Overview

- **Starter Organizations** use default retention settings and **cannot modify** retention rules.  
  By default, all artifacts are automatically removed **every month**.

- **Enterprise Organizations** can **fully customize** the retention rules for each module.  
  Available retention periods include:
    - **1 week**
    - **1 month**
    - **2 months**
    - **3 months**
    - **6 months**
    - **1 year**
    - **2 years**
    - **Never delete**

## Build Module

The **Build** section provides advanced artifact cleanup rules:

#### Delete Successful Build Artifacts
Automatically removes artifacts generated from **successful builds** that are older than the configured retention period.

#### Delete Failed Build Artifacts  
Deletes artifacts produced by **failed builds** that exceed the retention period.

#### Delete Artifacts Matching the Keyword  
Removes build artifacts that contain a **specific file extension** in their name.  
Example: `.ipa`, `.apk`, `.txt`

#### Keep Artifacts Matching the Keyword
Preserves build artifacts that match specific file extention.  
Example: Keep all `.ipa` files while deleting other formats.

:::info Build Retention Rules
- **Delete Artifacts Matching the Keyword** and **Keep Artifacts Matching the Keyword** cannot contain the same values.
- Both fields cannot be empty at the same time, Appcircle will **not delete any build artifacts**.
- **Delete Artifacts Matching the Keyword** setting cannot be empty.
- Only **Keep Artifacts Matching the Keyword** can be empty if you would like to delete all build artifacts or just some specific file types.

## Publish to Stores

**Publish to Stores** module includes specific rules for published artifacts:

#### Delete Publish Module Artifacts
Automatically deletes artifacts that have been **published** and are older than the retention period.

#### Keep if Marked as RC
When enabled, preserves artifacts marked as **Release Candidate (RC)** even if they exceed the retention period.

#### Keep if Published to Store
Retains artifacts already **released to stores** such as:
 - Apple App Store
 - Google Play Store
 - Huawei AppGallery
 - Microsoft Intune

:::info
Artifacts already **published to the Enterprise Portal** via **Beta** or **Live** channels are **not deleted**, even if they surpass the defined retention period.
:::

:::tip
If an app version with an upload date that exceeds the allowed retention period was recently unpublished from Enterprise Portal channels, it will not be deleted, as it was previously used in the Portal within the allowed retention period.

## Artifacts Reports

The **Artifacts Reports** section provides a detailed overview of artifacts that were **automatically or manually deleted** based on your configured **Retention Period** rules.

This report helps organizations monitor and verify which artifacts have been removed, when the deletion occurred, and which rule or trigger caused it.

### Overview

Each row in the report represents a deleted artifact and includes key details such as:

| Column | Description                                                                                                                                  |
