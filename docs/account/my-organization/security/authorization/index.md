# Authorization

The **Authorization** section allows you to manage user permissions and control access within your Appcircle environment. Set up authorization methods such as RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and SSO (Single Sign-On) to ensure that users have the appropriate access to projects, integrations, and resources, safeguarding your data and workflows.

We support RBAC authorization and SSO-based authorization methods. Current headlines and the actions you can complete are listed below:

- [**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Authorization**](/account/my-organization/security/authorization/rbac-authorization)
- [**SSO Authorization**](/account/my-organization/security/authorization/sso-authorization)
- [**Enterprise App Store SSO Authorization**](/account/my-organization/security/authorization/store-sso-authorization)
