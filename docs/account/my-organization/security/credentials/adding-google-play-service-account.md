# Google Play Service Account

Google Service Account is required to upload your binary to Google Play Store. This JSON key must be added to your account to publish apps to Google Play.

1. Please go to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) and create a Google Cloud Project.

2. **Enable** the `Google Play Android Developer API` for your Google Cloud Project.

    Skipping this step will result in your JSON being rejected by Appcircle because it will not have access to the project.

Once your selections are made, click Share to apply.
