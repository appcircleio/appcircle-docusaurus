# Enterprise Portal Single Sign-On (SSO) Providers Configuration

## 1. Introduction

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to log in to Appcircle using their existing credentials from an Identity Provider (IdP). By integrating SSO, organizations can streamline user access management, enhance security, and provide a seamless login experience across multiple platforms.

This document specifically covers the SSO configuration for the Enterprise Portal (Enterprise App Store module). Please note that a separate SSO configurations exists for the [Appcircle Login](/account/my-organization/security/authentications/sso-authentication) and [Testing Portal](/account/my-organization/security/authentications/distribution-sso-authentication). This document does not cover those configurations.

Currently, this configuration supports enabling SSO with only one identity provider at a time. Adding multiple SSO providers is not supported at this moment but may be available in the future.

The SSO setup described in this document integrates the selected identity provider with the Appcircle IAM module, essentially adding the provider as an identity source for Appcircle.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to configuring SSO with various supported identity providers, including Auth0, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory), Okta, OneLogin and Keycloak. Whether you choose to implement OpenID Connect or SAML, this guide will walk you through the necessary steps to ensure a successful integration with Appcircle.


### Supported Identity Providers

- Auth0:
    - Auth0 (OpenID Connect)
    - Auth0 (SAML)
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory):
    - Microsoft Entra ID (SAML)
- Okta:
    - Okta (OpenID Connect)
    - Okta (SAML)
- OneLogin:
    - OneLogin (SAML)
- Keycloak:
    - Keycloak (OpenID Connect)
    - Keycloak (SAML)

Each section will provide detailed instructions for configuring your chosen identity provider, including screenshots and troubleshooting tips to ensure a smooth setup process.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before you begin configuring SSO for Appcircle, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- An active account with one of the supported Identity Providers (IdPs).
- Administrative access to both the Identity Provider and Appcircle's platform. For more details, refer to the [Appcircle Role Management Documentation](/account/my-organization/profile-and-team/role-management#organization-management-permissions).
- Access to SAML tracing tools or other relevant debugging resources.
- SSL certificates (if required by your IdP).

These prerequisites will ensure that the SSO configuration process is smooth and any issues that arise can be quickly resolved.


### SSO Terminology

Understanding the following key terms will help you navigate the SSO configuration process more effectively:

- **Identity Provider (IdP):** The service responsible for authenticating the user and issuing identity information. Common examples include Auth0, Microsoft Entra ID, Okta, OneLogin, and Keycloak.
- **Service Provider (SP):** The service (in this case, Appcircle) that relies on the IdP to authenticate users and grant them access. The SP uses the identity information provided by the IdP to manage user sessions and permissions.
- **SAML Assertion:** A secure XML document sent by the IdP to the SP, containing the user's authentication and authorization information. This document is a core component of the SAML protocol, used to establish a user’s identity across different services.
- **OpenID Connect Token:** A token used in the OpenID Connect protocol to convey identity information from the IdP to the SP. This token typically includes user information and is crucial for establishing secure communication between the IdP and SP.

These terms form the foundation of the SSO process, where the IdP authenticates the user and the SP relies on this authentication to grant access. For more in-depth information, refer to the [OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) or the [SAML specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-core-2.0-os.pdf).

## 3. General Configuration Steps

The following steps outline the general process for configuring Single Sign-On (SSO) with Appcircle, applicable to all supported identity providers. These steps will guide you through the initial setup within the Appcircle dashboard and the configuration within your chosen identity provider.

<details>
    <summary>Step 1: Enable SSO in Appcircle</summary>

## 5. Troubleshooting

This section provides a list of common issues that users might encounter during the SSO setup and how to resolve them.


<details>
  <summary>5.1 Common Issues and Resolutions</summary>

- **Misconfigured SAML Assertions:** Ensure that the SAML assertions are correctly configured with the appropriate attributes and claims. Incorrect settings here can lead to failed logins.
- **Incorrect Redirect URIs:** Verify that the Redirect URIs configured in your identity provider match the ones set in Appcircle. Mismatches can cause authentication failures.
- **Token Mismatches:** If you encounter token mismatches, ensure that the correct Client ID, Client Secret, and endpoints are configured in both Appcircle and the identity provider.
- **Metadata Import Issues:** If the metadata import fails, manually check the SAML metadata for formatting errors or missing elements that may cause issues during import.
- **SSO Alias Not Recognized:** Make sure the SSO alias entered matches the one configured in Appcircle. Any discrepancies could prevent successful authentication.
- **Account Linking Problems:** If account linking fails, verify that the user’s email address in the identity provider matches the one in Appcircle.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5.2 Troubleshooting for Auth0 (OpenID Connect)</summary>

- **Callback URL Mismatch:** Ensure that the callback URL in Auth0 matches the one configured in Appcircle. This mismatch often causes authentication failures.
- **Invalid or Missing Redirect URIs:** Ensure that the redirect URIs in both Auth0 and Appcircle match exactly. Any mismatch, even in trailing slashes, can cause authentication to fail.
- **Invalid Client ID/Secret:** Verify that the Client ID and Secret are correctly entered in Appcircle’s SSO settings. Regenerate these values in Auth0 if needed.
- **Logs Don't Show Successful Login Event:** If the user successfully logs in with the identity provider, but the Appcircle logs do not show a successful login event, check the SAML Authentication Assertion returned by the IdP or analyze the HTTP trace for any discrepancies in Appcircle.
- **Misconfigured Scopes:** Ensure that the scopes requested in Appcircle match those defined in Auth0. Mismatches can lead to login failures.
- **Error Response Handling:** If Auth0 returns an error response, Appcircle may display a generic "500 Error: Oops, An Error Occurred. Invalid username or password." This issue often arises when users input incorrect details, such as entering an organization they are not a member of.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5.3 Troubleshooting for Auth0 (SAML)</summary>

- **Attribute Mapping Problems:** Verify that the attributes sent by Auth0 match those expected by Appcircle.
- **Token Mismatch:** Ensure the tokens issued by Auth0 match the expected format in Appcircle.
- **Incorrect Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL:** Verify that the ACS URL in Auth0 matches the one configured in Appcircle’s SSO settings.
- **SAML Assertion Issues:** Use tools like a SAML debugger to check the contents of the SAML assertion for correct format and expected values before entering them into Appcircle.
- **IdP Login Page Doesn't Display:** If the IdP login page fails to display, ensure the correct SSO URL is being used in Appcircle and that the binding method (HTTP-POST or HTTP-Redirect) is properly configured.
- **Certificate Issues:** Ensure the SAML certificate in Auth0 is valid and correctly configured. Invalid certificates can prevent proper authentication in Appcircle.
- **Error Response Handling:** If Auth0 returns an error response, Appcircle may display a generic "500 Error: Oops, An Error Occurred. Invalid username or password." This issue often arises when users input incorrect details, such as entering an organization they are not a member of.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5.4 Troubleshooting for Microsoft Entra ID (SAML)</summary>

- **Incorrect SAML Response:** Check that all required claims and attributes are configured correctly in Microsoft Entra ID.
- **Certificate Expiration:** Ensure that the SAML signing certificate used by Microsoft Entra ID is valid and not expired.
- **Misconfigured Claims or Attributes:** Ensure that the claims and attributes being sent from Microsoft Entra ID are correctly mapped and expected by Appcircle. Mismatches can lead to failed logins or incomplete user profiles.
- **Redirect Loop:** This often occurs due to incorrect reply URLs or session issues. Verify the reply URL in Microsoft Entra ID matches the one in Appcircle and that session cookies are correctly managed.
- **Invalid Certificate or Encryption Issues:** Ensure that the certificates used for signing and encryption are valid and correctly configured in both Microsoft Entra ID and Appcircle’s SSO settings. Expired certificates are a common cause of failures in SAML setups.
- **Unassigned Users:** Ensure that users are assigned to the enterprise application in Microsoft Entra ID. Unassigned users cannot authenticate through Appcircle.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>5.5 Troubleshooting for Okta (OpenID Connect)</summary>

- **Invalid Client ID/Secret:** Verify the Client ID and Secret in Appcircle match those configured in Okta.
- **Incorrect Scopes Configuration:** Ensure that the correct scopes, like `openid`, `profile`, and `email`, are requested by the client application and match those configured in Appcircle. Okta will reject requests with unsupported or misconfigured scopes.
- **Token Validation Issues:** Use Okta’s introspection endpoint for remote validation of access tokens to ensure they have not been revoked or expired in Appcircle’s SSO integration.
- **Key Rotation Problems:** Regularly update the public keys used by Okta in Appcircle’s SSO settings to ensure continuous validation of tokens, as Okta automatically rotates these keys multiple times a year.
- **Invalid Redirect URI:** Ensure that the redirect URI in Okta matches the one specified in Appcircle. Mismatches can cause authentication failures.
- **403 Forbidden Errors:** Ensure the user has the necessary permissions and that the application is set up correctly in Okta to prevent access issues in Appcircle.

  <summary>5.6 Troubleshooting for Okta (SAML)</summary>

- **Certificate Errors:** Verify that the SAML certificate used in Okta is valid and has not expired.
- **Incorrect ACS URL:** Ensure the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL in Okta matches the one configured in Appcircle.
- **Signing and Encryption Issues:** Verify that both signing and encryption certificates are correctly configured and up to date in both Okta and Appcircle. Expired or incorrectly installed certificates are a common cause of SAML failures.
- **Misconfigured SAML Responses:** Use Okta’s SAML troubleshooting tools to validate the SAML response, ensuring that all required fields are present and correctly formatted before integrating with Appcircle.
- **Invalid SSO URL or Mismatched Entity IDs:** Confirm that the SSO URL and Entity ID configured in Okta are correctly set up in Appcircle’s SSO settings to prevent login issues or errors in the authentication process.
- **Clock Skew:** Ensure the system clocks of both Okta and Appcircle are synchronized to avoid timing issues in the authentication process.
