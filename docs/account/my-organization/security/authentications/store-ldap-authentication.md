# Enterprise Portal LDAP Settings

This document serves as a helpful guide for setting up and managing LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) login integration within our organizational system.
Whether you're new to LDAP or looking to streamline your authentication process, this document provides step-by-step instructions to ensure a smooth setup and management experience.

To get started, simply navigate to the **Security** page within our platform and click on the "Add New" button next to LDAP Login under the **Authentications** section.
From there, you'll be guided through the process of creating LDAP configurations, including filling in the necessary details and enabling Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for added security.

Once set up, LDAP Login allows you to control access to distributed links and adjust distribution authorization through the Distribution Profiles.
This means you can tailor access permissions according to your organization's specific needs.

If you ever need to remove LDAP Login integration, the document also provides clear instructions for doing so, ensuring that your system remains secure and up-to-date.

To start, go to [My Organization](/account/my-organization) > Security screen and press the **Add New** button next to LDAP Login under the **Authentications** section.

- The **Create New Authentication** window will open, presenting two options:
    - **Create New Authentication**
    - **Create From Existing Authentication**
You can create a new configuration or create one from an existing configuration. Click on the **Create New Authentication** section to create new configuration.
Please refer the [**Create From Existing LDAP Configuration**](/account/my-organization/security/authentications/store-ldap-authentication#create-from-existing-ldap-configuration).

- The "Order" field in your LDAP configuration determines the priority or sequence in which providers are utilized when conducting a user lookup.
  Providers are entities responsible for retrieving user information from LDAP servers.
  Specifying the order allows you to prioritize certain providers over others, ensuring efficient user lookup operations.

Provider A: Order: 1

Provider B: Order: 2

In this example, when conducting a user lookup, Appcircle will first attempt to retrieve information from "Provider A" before falling back to "Provider B".

- The "Connection Pooling" option in your LDAP configuration determines whether Appcircle should utilize connection pooling for accessing the LDAP server.
