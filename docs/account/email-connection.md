# Email Connection and Notifications Subscribtion

This feature allows users with specified e-mail addresses to be notified by e-mail of the actions specified in Appcircle (starting a build, adding an IOS certificate, the store submission process, etc.).

:::info

Appcircle mail notification can work independently for each module. For example, you can send notifications to different people for events under the Build module and to different people for store submission operations.

You can also define more than one email address for a module and send notifications.

If the user unsubscribes via email, the relevant email will be deleted directly from the module. If you want to send notifications, you will need to add the mail address again.
