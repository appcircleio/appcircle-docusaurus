Appcircle features a separate distribution screen designed to facilitate easy downloading of shared applications.

For iOS and Android, users can log in via the shared link and view all the versions shared with them. Downloading iOS and Android binaries is managed through the specific flows for each operating system.

## Login

When a binary is shared with users through the share action for Live and Beta channels, they will receive a link for access.

Upon clicking the link, users will be redirected to the Enterprise Portal.
