Appcircle has a separate distribution screen designed to make it easy for users to download the shared applications easily.

For iOS and Android, the users can login from the link shared and then view all the versions shared with them. Downloading iOS and Android binaries are done through the specific flows of each OS.

## Login

When a binary is shared with users by share or notify actions for Live and Beta channels, the users will receive a link for access.

When the link is clicked, users will then be redirected to the Enterprise Store.;
