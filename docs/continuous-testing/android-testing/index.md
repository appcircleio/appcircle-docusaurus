# Android Testing

Ensure the quality and stability of your Android applications with a robust testing strategy.

## Running Unit Tests

Execute unit tests to validate the individual units of source code, helping you to identify and fix issues early in the development process. Unit tests are crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring that each component behaves as expected.

## Using Firebase Test Lab

Take advantage of Firebase Test Lab to test your Android apps across a wide range of devices and device configurations in the cloud. This service allows you to detect issues that only occur on certain device types or versions, without the need for a physical device lab.
