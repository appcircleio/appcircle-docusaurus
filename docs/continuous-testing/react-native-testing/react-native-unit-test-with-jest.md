# React Native Unit Test on Appcircle

Introduction to **React Native Unit Test** on Appcircle focuses on enhancing code quality and reliability by automating the testing of individual components and functionalities, ensuring seamless performance across different devices and environments.

## Configure Jest for Test Reports

Default Jest generates test result as JSON but the **React Native Unit Test** requires Junit style for parsing the test results.

Follow below steps to get Junit style test results:

1. First add **jest-junit** to your project as a dev dependency simply running below command:

```bash
  yarn add -D jest-junit
```

2. Add custom reporter configuration to your jest configuration file like below:

```bash
  reporters: [
    'default',
    [
      'jest-junit',
      {
        outputDirectory: './test-reports',
        outputName: 'junit-report.xml',
      },
    ],
  ],
```

When **React Native Unit Test** step will run the tests with parameter below to get test results.

```bash
yarn run jest --reporters=jest-junit
```

:::caution Output Directory

The **outputDirectory** must be set to **test-reports** at the root of the project, as the step will search for test results in that directory.

:::

:::caution Output Name

The **outputName** must be set to `\*-report.xml` at the end of the file name, as the step will search for test results for these files.

## Performing React Native Unit tests in Appcircle

To run your tests during the build process, you can simply add the **React Native Unit Test** step in your workflows.

Make sure the step is placed after the following:

- [**Node Install**](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/node-install)
- [**Npm/Yarn Commands**](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/npm-yarn-commands)

and  make sure the step is placed before the following: 

- [**Test Reports for React Native**](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/test-reports-react-native)
- [**Export Build Artifacts**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/export-build-artifacts)

For detailed information on Workflow structure, please visit the [**Workflows documentation**](/workflows).

For more information, please visit the **React Native Unit Test** workflow step [documentation](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/react-native-unit-test#prerequisites).


## Generating Test Report

If you add [Test Report Component](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/test-reports-react-native) to your workflow, Appcircle will show the result of your tests and code coverage with a clean UI.

You must add this step **after** the `React Native Unit Test` so that it can parse test results. Your workflow should look like the below.


## Showing Test Reports

Appcircle can show passing and failing tests in compact UI.

:::caution Test Suites

The name for Test Suites appears as **undefined** because the tests are not wrapped inside a describe block, which is required for the suite name to be properly displayed in the report.
