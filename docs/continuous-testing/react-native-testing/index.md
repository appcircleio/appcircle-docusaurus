# React Native Testing

It involves validating the functionality and user interface of React Native apps through unit, integration, and UI tests to ensure consistent performance across platforms.

## Running Unit & UI Tests

Running Unit & UI Tests in React Native involves testing individual components and functions (unit tests) to ensure they work correctly in isolation, and testing the app's user interface (UI tests) to validate user interactions and the rendering of components across platforms.

These tests help maintain the reliability and performance of React Native apps by catching bugs early and ensuring a smooth user experience.
