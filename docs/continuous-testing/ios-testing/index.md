# iOS Testing

Maximize the reliability and user experience of your iOS applications through effective testing.

## Running Unit & UI Tests

Leverage unit testing to verify the correctness of individual code units and UI tests to ensure the user interface works as intended. These tests are integral parts of iOS development, helping you catch and resolve issues before release.

By incorporating both unit and UI tests, you can create a comprehensive test coverage that improves the overall quality of your iOS applications.
