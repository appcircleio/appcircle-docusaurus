# iOS Build Infrastructure

Depending on which Xcode version you select, Appcircle creates a brand new virtual machine running. 

- If your selected pool from config is "Default Intel Pool", virtual machine will be macOS Monterey `v.12.5.1 `.
- If your selected pool from config is "Default M1 Pool", virtual machine will be macOS Monterey `v.12.6`.

macOS images run on a fresh Docker environment for stability and performance. They are created just for your build and become ready within seconds.

During the build process, you can install any dependencies and run commands using "custom script" steps in the build workflow. This gives you complete control over your build and the virtual machine.

:::info

Please note that virtual machines are wiped off after a build is executed (no matter success or fail) and anything you installed in the virtual machine will be gone.

### Available Xcode Versions

Our macOS build agents have Xcode versions 14.2.x, 14.1.x, 14.0.x, 13.4.x, 13.3.x, 13.2.x, 13.1.x, 13.0.x, 12.5.x available.

### M1 Macs

We've started providing M1 Mac mini's to select enterprise customers starting from April 2022. We'll gradually enable M1 Macs to all enterprise customers first, and then to all plans.

If you'd like an M1 Mac for your builds, please request an invite:

### Using your own computer for build

Appcircle supports using a 3rd party computer to perform builds. You can create your own build environment by installing the operating system and other tools and dependencies you need to tell Appcircle to use that environment to perform builds.

[**Get in touch with Appcircle if you need enterprise features.**](https://appcircle.io/support)

### macOS Build Agent Stacks

There are many pre-installed packages in virtual machines. You can get a full list of pre-installed packages by running Bash commands in "custom script" steps.
