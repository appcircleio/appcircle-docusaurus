# Build Infrastructure

Select the optimal build stack for your iOS or Android applications to ensure compatibility and performance.

## iOS Build Stacks

Choose from a variety of iOS build stacks compatible with different versions of Xcode, Swift, and the iOS SDK to match your project's requirements.

## Android Build Stacks

For Android projects, select a build stack that aligns with your needs for specific versions of the Android SDK, Gradle, and other build tools.

Properly setting up your build infrastructure is key to a smooth, efficient, and successful build process for your mobile applications.
