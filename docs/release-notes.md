:::caution

To ensure the App Store status remains current, the following conditions must be met:

- The current profile necessitates valid store credentials defined within the Signing Identity module and must be selected.
- Alignment of the published app's identifier, version, and build number with the Appcircle app version records is essential.
- Identification of one of the app version records as the designated release candidate is required.
- The service will continue updating the app status until it reaches the 'READY_TO_SALE' or 'READY_TO_DISTRIBUTE' states.
- Initially, the service checks the App Store status; in the event of no matching records, it subsequently conducts a search within TestFlight.

- The self-hosted Appcircle server now adopts single-node single drive MinIO instead of multi-node single drive MinIO in the default configuration, which decreases disk consumption significantly. <SelfHostedBadge/>

:::caution

Upgrading from older versions to `v3.14.0` or later, requires MinIO migration that should be done interactively while upgrading.

In order to migrate to single-node single drive MinIO configuration or stay with the deprecated multi-node single drive MinIO configuration, **you must follow the instructions** that are defined in the [MinIO Migration](/self-hosted-appcircle/configure-server/minio-migration) document.

:::

:::tip

Fresh self-hosted server installations do not require any manual intervention for the MinIO configuration.

The single-node single drive [MinIO configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/configure-server/minio-migration) is applied by default on fresh installations.

### üÜï New Feature

- Permission (role) naming has been changed in [advanced role management](https://docs.appcircle.io/account/my-organization#advanced-role-management). Also, there are some new roles added for better scope management in your organization. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- [Share with Testers](https://docs.appcircle.io/distribute/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile#share-your-application-with-the-test-groups-manually) in Testing Distribution now has a new toggle option that enables you to display only the shared app version instead of all app versions. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Appcircle Notifications now has improvements on [Slack](https://docs.appcircle.io/account/slack/slack-notifications), [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.appcircle.io/account/teams-notifications), [Email](https://docs.appcircle.io/account/email-connection), and [Webhook](https://docs.appcircle.io/account/webhooks) channels that allows you to share release notes, build logs, and test reports via notifications. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- The Store Submit module has been deprecated and it will be replaced by the brand-new [Publish](https://docs.appcircle.io/publish-module) module. You should transfer your apps to the [Publish](https://docs.appcircle.io/publish-module) module in order to submit your apps to the stores. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- The Appcircle CLI has undergone a complete revision to make it compatible with the latest Appcircle API. Now it also supports self-hosted Appcircle servers. You can see all the recent changes made in the [changelog](https://github.com/appcircleio/appcircle-cli/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and follow [configuration instructions](https://docs.appcircle.io/self-hosted-appcircle/configure-server/appcircle-cli) to use the CLI with a self-hosted Appcircle server. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>

### :muscle: Improvement

- You can now [download](https://docs.appcircle.io/publish-module/#version-download) app version artifacts (`ipa`, `aab`, or `apk`) in the Publish module. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>

- Administrators can now enable or disable the "Edit Username" feature from **Login Settings** on the self-hosted Appcircle server. <SelfHostedBadge/>
- `Manager`, `Operator`, and `Viewer` build profile roles have view permission for the [self-hosted runners](https://docs.appcircle.io/self-hosted-appcircle/self-hosted-runner/configure-runner/manage-runners) list but cannot enable or disable any runner on the list. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- License limits for monthly tester emails and artifact storage size were removed from "Organization > Billing > Usages". Keep in mind that for fair usage, the limits exist but are higher when compared to previous plan limits. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Now only the underscore character ("\_") can be used in [environment variable](https://docs.appcircle.io/environment-variables/managing-variables) group naming. Appcircle will not allow other special characters in group names. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>

- User redirection when invited to the organization was improved according to several different cases, like registered, not registered, or SSO login. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Now you can enhance the SSO login experience by eliminating the "SSO Alias" requirement on the login screen. For this, you should create an Appcircle-compatible login URL so that users can pass through the "SSO Alias" step when they access Appcircle using your custom login URL. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Publish flow step statuses, and the last step status in the [version list](https://docs.appcircle.io/publish-module/#publish-versions) will be in `waiting` status unless the runner executes them. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- The contact button at the bottom right of the page has been removed. You can reach us through the [Contact](https://appcircle.io/contact) or [Slack](https://slack.appcircle.io/) channels. <CloudBadge/>
- The duration and results of internal scheduled tasks can now be tracked by the schedule manager in the infrastructure. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- You can see the Git URL under the repository name while selecting the repository on a new connection, which avoids confusion when the team has the same repository name in different locations. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Queue waiting records with a waiting time of 0 min will no longer appear in the queue waiting reports for better experience. <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Supported Xcode versions that you see in the "starting workflow" step in build logs are ordered descending (latest first) for better readability. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
- Testing Distribution [distribution profile](https://docs.appcircle.io/account/my-organization#distribution-profile-permissions) permissions have undergone revision with new `Operator` role and other role naming changes. <CloudBadge/> <SelfHostedBadge/>
