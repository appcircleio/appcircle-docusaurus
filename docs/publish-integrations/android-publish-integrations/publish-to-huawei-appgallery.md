# Publish to Huawei AppGallery

Appcircle supports sending [APK](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-releaseapkrpk-0000001106463276) and [AAB](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/app/agc-help-releasebundle-0000001100316672) binaries to [Huawei AppGallery](https://appgallery.huawei.com/) through the Publish module.

### Prerequisites

Before uploading a binary to the store, please make sure that an application listing is created in Huawei AppGallery Connect and the initial binary is manually uploaded with the same keystore and the application ID. Otherwise, the store upload process will fail.

You also need to have an AppGallery Connect API and its key as a JSON file. Please refer to the following document for more information on creating your API key.

After completing the integration with Huawei AppGallery API Key, go to [Publishing Settings](/publish-module/publish-settings). In the [`Store Credential`](/publish-module/publish-settings#store-credentials) section, select the Huawei AppGallery API Key you uploaded, from the drop-down list.

If you are using [Publish Variables](/publish-module/publish-settings#publish-variables), you should select them in the [Publishing Settings](/publish-module/publish-settings) window.
