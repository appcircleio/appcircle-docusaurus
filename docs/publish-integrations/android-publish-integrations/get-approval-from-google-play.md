# Get Approval From Google Play

The **Get Approval From Google Play** step ensures that your app release is approved by checking its status on the [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console). This allows you to monitor the progress of your submission and take any necessary actions to address any issues or concerns that may arise during the review process.

## Prerequisites

The Publish flow steps that need to be executed before running the **Get Approval via Email** step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                                          | Description                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**Publish to Google Play**](/publish-integrations/android-publish-integrations/publish-to-google-play) | The app must be published to Google Play before checking the status of the app version in the Google Play Console. |

:::warning

If you have previously submitted this app version to the Google Play Console, you do not need to add the **Publish to Google Play** step.

:::

You also need to have a Google Service Account and its key as a JSON file. Please refer to the following document for more information about service accounts:

</ContentRef>

After completing the integration with Google Play Services, go to [Publishing Settings](/publish-module/publish-settings). In the [`Store Credential`](/publish-module/publish-settings#store-credentials) section, select the Google Play Store API Key you uploaded, from the drop-down list.

If you are using [Publish Variables](/publish-module/publish-settings#publish-variables), you should select them in the [Publishing Settings](/publish-module/publish-settings) window.
