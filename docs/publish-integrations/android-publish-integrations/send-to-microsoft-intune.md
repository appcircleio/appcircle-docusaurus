# Publish to Microsoft Intune

This step enables you to submit your line of business apps to the [Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune).

### Prerequisites

Below are the prerequisite steps necessary for this operation, accompanied by their descriptions.

### Providing Microsoft Graph API Credentials for Accessing Intune

To send an app from Appcircle to Microsoft Intune, you need to [register an application with the Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2) and provide this application's credentials.

:::info
Appcircle utilizes [Microsoft Graph APIs to publish apps in Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-graph-overview?view=graph-rest-1.0). Therefore, you need to grant the following permissions to the application you registered and provided credentials for on the Microsoft Identity Platform.

- DeviceManagementApps.Read.All
- DeviceManagementApps.ReadWrite.All

You can find detailed information about granting permissions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-call-a-web-api-with-curl?tabs=dotnet6&pivots=no-api#add-application-permissions-to-allow-access-to-a-web-api).
