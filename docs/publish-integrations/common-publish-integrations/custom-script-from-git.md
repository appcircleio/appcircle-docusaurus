# Custom Script from Git

You can use the **Custom Script from Git** steps to execute scripts stored in a Git repository within your [Publish flow](/publish-module/publish-flow). Instead of writing scripts directly in Appcircle, this step clones your repository and runs the specified script file, enabling centralized script management and version control. These scripts will run on the runner, giving you access to all the capabilities of the publish environment.

The guidelines detailed in the **Custom Script from Git** documentation for [Build Workflow](/workflows) also apply to the Custom Script in [Publish](/publish-module). Therefore, this document will not repeat those details. For comprehensive information about the **Custom Script from Git** step, please visit the link below:
