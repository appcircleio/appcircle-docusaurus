## Using Environment Variables

You can dynamically populate subject and content using environment variables. They can also be used to securely fill your email settings.

### Creating Environment Variables

First, you need to define the environment variables. To do this, go to the Publish module and select Publish Variables. From there, you can start creating the variables for your email settings.

For more information, please refer to the [Publish Variables](/publish-module/publish-variables) documentation.

### Selecting Environment Variables

After creating the environment variables, you will need to select this variable group from your profile settings.

You can now use the defined environment variables in your email settings, including the subject and content. For example:

```text
Subject:
Build $AC_BUILD_NUMBER for $AC_PROJECT_NAME is Ready

Email Content:
Hi team,

A new build for $AC_PROJECT_NAME (Build #$AC_BUILD_NUMBER) has been successfully published.

Best,
Appcircle CI/CD
