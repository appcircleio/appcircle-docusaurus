# Custom Script

You can use the **Custom Script** steps to add extra functionalities in your [Publish flow](/publish-module/publish-flow). Appcircle will execute the commands specified in your custom scripts, allowing you to perform custom actions. These scripts will run on the runner, giving you access to all the capabilities of the publish environment.

The guidelines detailed in the **Custom Script** documentation for [Build Workflow](/workflows) also apply to the Custom Script in [Publish](/publish-module). Therefore, this document will not repeat those details. For comprehensive information about the Custom Script step, please visit the link below:
