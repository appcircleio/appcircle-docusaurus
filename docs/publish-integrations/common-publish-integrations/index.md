With Appcircle's Publish module, you can submit your application to external stores such as App Store, Google Play, Huawei AppGallery or Microsoft Intune, as well as to Appcircle's Testing Distribution module.

Testing Distribution module allows you to distribute your application without the need for any external tools.

## [Send Email](/publish-integrations/common-publish-integrations/send-email)
The **Send Email** step allows you to send customized email notifications during your Appcircle Publish Flow for both iOS and Android builds. This can be used to alert stakeholders, notify of publish statuses, or provide deployment-related information.
