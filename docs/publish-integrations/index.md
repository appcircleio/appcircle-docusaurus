### App Information from App Store

Fetch and display your app's current listing information directly from the App Store to ensure all details are correct and up to date.

### Send to App Store

Streamline the process of submitting your iOS apps for review and release on the Apple App Store.

### Send to TestFlight

Distribute pre-release versions of your iOS apps to testers worldwide using TestFlight, allowing for valuable feedback before the final release.

### Get Approval from TestFlight

After submitting to TestFlight, this step involves monitoring and managing the approval process, ensuring that your app meets all necessary criteria for beta testing.
