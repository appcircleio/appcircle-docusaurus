# Platform-Specific Usage

Tailor your build environment with platform-specific environment variables to manage different aspects of iOS and Android builds.

### iOS Builds

Configure environment variables specific to iOS builds to control various settings and behaviors in Xcode, managing aspects like provisioning profiles, code signing, and more.

### Android Builds

Set up environment variables for Android builds to fine-tune the Gradle build process, SDK versions, and other Android-specific parameters.

These platform-specific variables offer the flexibility needed to customize the build processes according to the unique requirements of each platform.
