# Platform-Specific Usage

Tailor your build environment with platform-specific environment variables to manage different aspects of iOS and Android builds.

### [iOS Builds](/environment-variables/platform-specific-usage/using-environment-variables-in-ios-projects)

Configure environment variables specific to iOS builds to control various settings and behaviors in Xcode, managing aspects like provisioning profiles, code signing, and more.

### [Android Builds](/environment-variables/platform-specific-usage/using-environment-variables-in-android-projects)

Set up environment variables for Android builds to fine-tune the Gradle build process, SDK versions, and other Android-specific parameters.

These platform-specific variables offer the flexibility needed to customize the build processes according to the unique requirements of each platform.
