# Introduction to Environment Variables

Environment variables let you extend your build configuration. There are several read-only Appcircle variables and you can add your own variables to export during the build process and use in custom build scripts.

Environment variables have a key and a secret value that can be defined manually to be used in your project builds globally.

You can create groups of environment variables and import these groups to your builds to customize your builds with additional parameters.
