# App Center CodePush

[**App Center CodePush**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/distribution/codepush/) is an App Center cloud service that enables React Native developers to deploy mobile app updates directly to their usersâ€™ devices. It works by acting as a central repository where developers can publish certain updates (for example, JS, HTML, CSS, and image changes), and apps can query for updates (using the provided client SDKs).

You can seamlessly integrate **App Center CodePush** into your workflow with Appcircle, facilitating easy setup and utilization within your existing development processes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **App Center CodePush** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Git Clone](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone) | The repository needs to be cloned to begin the CodePush process. After this step, the variable `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` will be set. |

Avoid hard-coding sensitive information, like tokens and API keys, directly into the step parameters.

We recommend using [**Environment Variables**](/environment-variables/managing-variables) groups for such sensitive variables.
