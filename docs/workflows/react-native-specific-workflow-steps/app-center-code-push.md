:::danger

As [Microsoft announced](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/appcenter/retirement),
> "Visual Studio App Center is scheduled for retirement on March 31, 2025. After that date, it will not be possible to sign in with your user account nor make API calls."

Therefore, the AppCenter CodePush step in Appcircle will also be deprecated after this date.
