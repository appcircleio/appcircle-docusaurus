# Install Node

React Native applications commonly depend on certain Node modules. This workflow step makes sure that you have the required Node version installed in the build agent to build your React Native application.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Install Node** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [**Git Clone**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone) | Clone the selected repository to the build machine. Please use the **Install Node** step after this step. |

:::caution

Please note that this step should be used before steps that need the **npm/yarn Commands** step. To avoid any problems, you can run this step after the **Git Clone** step.
