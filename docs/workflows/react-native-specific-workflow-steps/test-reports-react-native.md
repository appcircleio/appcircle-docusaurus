# Test Reports for React Native

The Appcircle **Test Report** step displays your test results and code coverage in an aesthetically pleasing user interface.

This component supports the following test and coverage formats:

- [JUnit](https://junit.org) - For Java-based test reporting.

For additional details, please refer to the document: [**Generating Test Report**](/continuous-testing/react-native-testing/react-native-ui-test-with-detox#generating-test-report)

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Test Reports for React Native** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                                           | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**React Native Unit Test**](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/react-native-unit-test) | Run unit tests in your project to generate an `junit-report.xml` file containing the test outcomes.   |
| [**React Native UI Test**](/workflows/react-native-specific-workflow-steps/react-native-ui-test)     | Run UI tests in your project to generate an `e2e-report.xml` file containing the test outcomes. |

:::caution Prerequisites

To able to use the **Test Report** component, not necessary to use both test step **React Native UI Test** and **React Native Unit Test** at the same time. But if these test steps are included in the flow, they must be used before the **Test Report** component.

### Input Variables

This step contains some input variable(s). It needs these variable(s) to work. The table below gives explanation for this variable(s).

| Variable Name             | Description                                                                                                                      | Status   |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `$AC_TEST_RESULT_PATH`     | Define the directory and its subdirectories for searching compatible test files.                                                 | Required |
| `$AC_COVERAGE_RESULT_PATH` | For native iOS projects, tests automatically set this variable. For other projects, you must specify the coverage path manually. | Optional |

:::caution

To view the output artifacts on the [**Download Artifacts**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/export-build-artifacts) page, please ensure that the [**Export Build Artifacts**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/export-build-artifacts) step is included in your Workflow after this step.
