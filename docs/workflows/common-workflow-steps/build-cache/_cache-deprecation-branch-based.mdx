:::caution

Previously, the **Cache Pull/Push** steps used branch-based caching by default. This behavior has been deprecated, and branches now share the same cache by default.

If you prefer to continue using branch-based caching, you can manually add branch information to your cache label. For further information, please check out the following documentation:

- [How to Configure Branch-Base Caching](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/build-cache/how-to-configure-branch-based-caching)
