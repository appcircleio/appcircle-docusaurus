:::caution

The build token ID, generated at the start of the build, expires after **3 hours**. If the **Cache Pull** or **Cache Push** step starts beyond this time, caching will fail.

This may lead to a `404 Error` in the **Cache Pull** step during the next build if the **Cache Push** step is not completed successfully.
