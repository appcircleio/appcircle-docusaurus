# Snyk Scan Security

[Snyk Security Scan](https://snyk.io/learn/vulnerability-scanner/) is a powerful tool designed to identify and resolve vulnerabilities within your project's dependencies. Leveraging Snyk's extensive vulnerability database, this tool thoroughly analyzes libraries and frameworks used in your project, offering actionable insights to mitigate potential risks.

The **Snyk Security Scan** step integrates directly into Appcircleâ€™s CI/CD workflows, allowing developers to automatically scan project dependencies for vulnerabilities with each build.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Snyk Scan Security** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step | Description                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Git Clone**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) | Fetches the repository to be built from the specified branch, ensuring that the [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli) can run on the repository path. |

:::danger Sensitive Variables

Please do not use sensitive variables such as **Username**, **Password**, **API Key**, or **Personal Access Key** directly within the step.

We recommend using [**Environment Variables**](/environment-variables/managing-variables) groups for such sensitive variables.
