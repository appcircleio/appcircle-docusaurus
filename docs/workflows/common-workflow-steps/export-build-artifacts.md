| Variable Name                 | Description                                    | Status |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------|
| `$AC_UPLOAD_DIR`              | If a folder path is specified, the files in this folder will be exported as artifacts. If a file path is specified, that file will be exported as an artifact. Uploading files with a 0 byte size in the specified path will be skipped. The default folder path is **`$AC_OUTPUT_DIR`**. | Required |
| `$AC_DISABLE_UPLOAD_ON_FAIL`  | The Delete Artifact for failed build variable is **false** by default. This variable allows you to export artifacts if a build succeeds, so that they do not take up disk space.  | Optional |
