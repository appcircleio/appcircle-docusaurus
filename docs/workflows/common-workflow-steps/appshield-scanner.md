# Appshield App Scanner for Android / iOS

Appshield Scanner starts its analysis by accepting the application file (AAB/APK for Android, IPA for iOS) and starting dynamic runtime tests after initial file and format validations. 
It is important to note that while many scanning solutions use ARM/x86_64 based emulators and sandbox environments, Appshield performs all these dynamic tests in **real/physical Android and/or iOS devices.**
At the end of the dynamic test session, Appshield indicates which security measures/hardenings are present and implemented in the app. If some testcases were failed due to unforeseen errors or cannot be tested various bypass mechanisms 
implemented by the app itself, Appshield then starts a static, AI-powered analysis for mentioned testcases to gather additional findings and then reaches a final verdict.

**Security measures/hardenings Appshield Scanner checks for in an application includes (but not limited to)**:

* **Root/Jailbreak Detection**: Detects whether the device has been rooted or jailbroken, which increases the risk of unauthorized system access and tampering.
* **Frida / Anti-Hooking Detection:** Identifies runtime instrumentation frameworks (like Frida) or hooks that intercept and modify function calls to prevent dynamic analysis and tampering.
* **Anti Code Injection Detection:** Detects attempts to inject or load unsigned/native code or libraries into the app’s process to prevent unauthorized code execution.
* **Anti Debugging Detection:** Detects debuggers or debugger-like behaviors (ptrace, debug flags, wait loops) to prevent runtime inspection and breakpoints.
* **Screenshot / Screen Recording Detection:** Detects and blocks or flags attempts to capture the app’s UI via screenshots or screen recording to protect sensitive UI content.
* **Screen Mirroring Detection:** Detects when the app’s display is being mirrored to another device (e.g., via AirPlay or casting) to prevent remote observation of sensitive data.
* **Keylogger Detection:** Detects behaviors or hooks that capture keystrokes or input events to prevent credential or data exfiltration.
* **Tapjacking Detection:** Detects overlay or UI manipulation attacks that trick users into tapping hidden controls or approving actions they didn’t intend.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Appshield Scanner** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [**Android Build**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build) | The app required for this step is generated by the **Android Build** (or alternative build steps).                                                                       |
| [**Android Sign**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-sign)   | If you intend to use a signed app, this step must be executed beforehand to process the output. If your app is already signed in the build step, you can skip this step. |

:::danger

If a step other than the **Android Build** or **Android Sign** step is used to build or sign the app, then the **Appshield Scanner** step depends on this step.

### Input Variables

This step contains some input variable(s). It needs these variable(s) to work. The table below gives explanation for this variable(s).

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/android-workflow-components-appdome-build-to-secure_2.png'/>

:::danger Sensitive Variables

Please do not use sensitive variables such as **Username**, **Password**, **API Key**, or **Personal Access Key** directly within the step.

We recommend using [**Environment Variables**](/build/build-environment-variables) groups for such sensitive variables.
