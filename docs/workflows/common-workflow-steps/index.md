# Common Workflow Steps

The steps listed below are common across all build profiles regardless of the target OS and platform.

You can find the full list of available workflow steps in our [workflow marketplace](https://github.com/appcircleio/appcircle-workflow-components) and under each workflow step in this document, you can find the related repository URL, which also includes the documentation for the related step.

## [Activate SSH Key](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/active-ssh-private-key)

This step sets up your SSH key in the build machine if you used one to connect your repository. This allows the build machine to connect to your private repository using your SSH key.

## [Add a Badge to Your App Icon](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/add-badge-app-icon)

With Appcircle's **Add Badge to Your App Icon** component, you can add badges and version information to your app icon, which you can also customize. This helps testers easily identify the version they are testing directly on the application icon.

## [Appium Server](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/appium-server)

This step installs [Appium Server](https://appium.io/) and starts it.

## [Authenticate with Netrc](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/authenticate-with-netrc)

The `.netrc` file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process. You can use this component to add credentials for hosts such as your repositories or external hosts. Git automatically recognizes the .netrc file. However, if you want to use the .netrc file with curl, you need to append the `-n` command line parameter. You may also use the `--netrc-optional` parameter if you don't always use the `.netrc` file with curl.

## [AWS Device Farm and Deploy](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/aws-device-farm-and-deploy)

**AWS Device Farm** is an application testing service that enables you to run your tests concurrently on multiple mobile devices to speed up the execution of your tests and generates videos and logs to help you quickly identify issues with your app.

## [Cache Push](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/build-cache/cache-push)

Learn to streamline your workflows by pushing data to cache with our easy-to-follow cache-push tutorial. Ideal for improving build performance.

## [Cache Pull](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/build-cache/cache-pull)

Discover the essentials of cache retrieval in our cache-pull guide. Speed up your build processes by mastering the art of efficiently pulling cached data.

## [Custom Script](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/custom-script)

You can use **Custom Script** steps for additional functionalities in your builds. Appcircle will run the commands in your custom scripts and perform the specified actions. These scripts will be run on the runner and you can use any functionality of the build environment as you need.

## [Code Reviews with Danger](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/danger)

**Danger** runs during your CI process and gives teams the chance to automate common code review chores. This provides another logical step in your build, through this Danger can help lint your rote tasks in daily code review. You can use Danger to codify your teamâ€™s norms. Leaving humans to think about harder problems.
