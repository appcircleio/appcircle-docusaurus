# Testinium

The **Testinium** step integrates the [Testinium](https://testinium.com/) testing platform into Appcircle's CI/CD workflow, allowing for automated testing of mobile applications directly within the Appcircle environment. This step enables developers to execute test scripts, analyze test outcomes, and verify the quality of their mobile apps before deployment

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Testinium** step, certain prerequisites must be completed. These prerequisites, detailed in the table below, vary depending on the platform:

#### For Android (Java / Kotlin and React Native) 

| Prerequisite Workflow Step        | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Android Build**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build) | Generates the app required for the **Testinium** step.                                                                           |
| [**Android Sign**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-sign)   | This step is required for signing the app. It processes the output for signing but can be skipped if the app is already signed. |

#### For iOS (Objective-C / Swift and React Native) 

| Prerequisite Workflow Step        | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Xcodebuild for Devices**](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps#xcodebuild-for-devices-archive--export) | Builds the application in ARM architecture and generates an `IPA` file. |

#### For Android Flutter 

| Prerequisite Workflow Step        | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Flutter Build for Android**](/workflows/flutter-specific-workflow-steps#flutter-build-for-android) | Generates the app required for the **Testinium** step.                                                                           |
| [**Android Sign**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-sign)   | This step is required for signing the app. It processes the output for signing but can be skipped if the app is already signed. |
