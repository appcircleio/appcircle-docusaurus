# Azure Boards

Azure Boards is a standalone service within the Azure DevOps suite that helps teams plan, track, and discuss work across the entire software development process. It provides a flexible, customizable platform for managing work items, such as user stories, bugs, tasks, and issues, so you can track your work item's progress throughout the development lifecycle.

You can use the [Azure Boards Component](https://github.com/appcircleio/appcircle-azure-boards-component/) to add a comment and change the status of your issues according to the status of your workflow.

### Prerequisites

There is no mandatory sequence for the use of this component. It depends on your business decision which step to use before or after in your workflow.

:::caution
Please note that once the Azure Boards component has run successfully, the status of the relevant article in your Azure Board account will be changed. If the build fails in Appcircle, an incorrect status may appear in your Azure Board account. Make sure you use it in the correct order in Workflow.
:::

### Configuration of Component

To add a comment, the issue ID `AC_AZUREBOARD_WORKITEM` must be supplied to the component. We need to get this issue ID dynamically so that our workflow can work for multiple branches. Appcircle components use environment variables to pass the state. We can add a step just before the Azure Boards component to prepare the necessary environment variables.

Let's say you're working on a feature branch called feature/onboarding-1. You may use the below Ruby script to get issue ID 1Â from the branch name and use this information with the Azure Boards component. Please see the [**Custom Script step documentation**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/upload-files-to-amazon-s3) for this implementation.

```ruby
branch = ENV['AC_GIT_BRANCH']
issue_number = branch.split('-')[1]
puts issue_number

# Write Environment Variable
open(env_var_path, 'a') { |f|
    f.puts "AC_AZUREBOARD_WORKITEM=#{issue_number}"
}
```

### Input Variables

There are some necessary parameters for this stepper to work properly. These parameters are given in the table below with their explanations.

:::danger
**Do not hard-code sensitive variables, such as tokens and API keys, directly to the parameters in the step.**

We recommend using [Environment Variables](/environment-variables/) groups for such sensitive variables.

### Changing Template

Appcircle provides a default template that adds the commit ID, branch name, and a couple of environment variables. When you're adding a comment, you may use HTML. This template can be edited and modified according to the Azure API. You can check [this document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/wit/work-items/update?view=azure-devops-rest-7.0&tabs=HTTP/) to create your custom comments.

Please check the [Azure Boards Component](https://github.com/appcircleio/appcircle-azure-boards-component/) documentation for more information.
