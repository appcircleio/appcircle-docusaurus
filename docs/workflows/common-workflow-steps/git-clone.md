# Git Clone

The **Git Clone** step is used to fetch the source code repository from a Git provider, such as [**GitHub**](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-github), [**GitLab**](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-gitlab), [**Bitbucket**](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-bitbucket), or [**Azure DevOps**](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-azure), and clone it into the runner where the build and deployment processes take place. This step ensures that the latest version of the codebase is available for subsequent build and deployment steps.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Git Clone** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [**Activate SSH Private Key**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/active-ssh-private-key) | This step sets up your SSH key on the build machine **if you used one to connect your repository with SSH**. |

:::caution

If you have not connected your repo via SSH, the **Git Clone** does not have any dependency on the **Activate SSH Private Key** step.

:::info

We recommend using this step at the beginning of the workflow to avoid any problems in the workflow.

### Input Variables

This step contains some input variable(s). It needs these variable(s) to work. The table below gives explanation for this variable(s).

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE2794-gitDetails.png' />

:::danger

After connecting the repository, the following [**Reserved Environment Variables**](/environment-variables/appcircle-specific-environment-variables), which **Git Clone** uses as input, will be automatically populated. Ensure that the variable you provide has a value if you intend to make any changes. **The required variables must not be left empty**.

:::

| Variable Name                 | Description                                    | Status           | 
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `$AC_GIT_URL`                 | URL of the repository. After the [**provider connection**](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile) is completed with the Git provider, these values will be set automatically. | Required |
| `$AC_GIT_COMMIT`              | Commit of the repository. This value will come from the Git provider. When a new commit is pushed, Appcircle fetches the details of the latest commit. | Optional |
| `$AC_GIT_BRANCH`              | Branch of the repository. You can find more details about [**branch management**](/build/build-process-management/build-profile-branch-operations). The branch information selected before starting manual build on the interface is automatically included here.  | Optional |
| `$AC_GIT_TAG`                 | Tag of the repository. If you have tags in your repository, Appcircle can start a build according to the tags. | Optional |
| `$AC_GIT_LFS`                 | Used to specify whether large files will be downloaded. The default value is `false`. | Optional |
| `$AC_GIT_SUBMODULE`           | Used to specify whether the submodule should be cloned. | Optional |
| `$AC_GIT_CACHE_CREDENTIALS`   | If this variable is set to `true`, the credentials will be cached. This can be useful if the same credentials are used for multiple repositories. The default value is `true`. | Optional |
| `$AC_GIT_EXTRA_PARAMS`        | If this variable is set, it sends additional parameters for Git requests. | Optional |

### Output Variables

The output(s) resulting from the operation of this component are as follows:

| Variable Name                 | Description                                    |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR`          | Specifies the root directory of the cloned repository. This path is automatically generated after the repository is cloned. |

## FAQ

### How can I solve network problems?

Users utilizing a self-hosted Git provider need to grant network access to use Appcircle. Access to private repositories can be achieved by whitelisting Appcircleâ€™s IP addresses. If the upload speed of the provider is restricted, Appcircle may take longer than expected to clone the repository.

Appcircle runners have an approximate internet speed of 10 Gbps. If your Git provider imposes a maximum upload speed limit, the **Git Clone** step in Appcircle will be restricted by this limit and **cannot** exceed it. As a result, the **Git Clone** step may take significantly longer to complete.

For detailed information, please visit our [**Accessing Repositories Within Internal Networks**](/build/manage-the-connections/accessing-repositories-in-internal-networks-firewalls).

### How can I check unexpected connection errors?

When repository access is granted for self-hosted Git providers, Appcircle directly attempts to clone the repository from the provider. If the upload speed limit set for your Git provider is too low, the **Git Clone** step will take a significantly longer time. Due to the prolonged download process, the Git provider may eventually reset the connection, resulting in an unexpected disconnection. To avoid such errors during unexpectedly long **Git Clone** steps, please check and adjust your upload speed limits.
