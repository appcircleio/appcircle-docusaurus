# Custom Script

You can use **Custom Script** steps for additional functionalities in your builds. Appcircle will run the commands in your custom scripts and perform the specified actions. These scripts will be run on the runner and you can use any functionality of the build environment as you need.

:::tip
Note that you can put the **Custom Script** component anywhere you want in the workflow. This step is used to add different capabilities to the existing workflow.

## Custom Script FAQ

### How to change JAVA version

If you want to change the JAVA version for your Android project, you can achieve this by changing the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Appcircle currently has `OpenJDK 11` (default), `OpenJDK 8`, `OpenJDK 17` and `OpenJDK 21`.

[Android Build](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build) step uses `OpenJDK 11` as default JDK version.

You can use the below custom script before your build step to change your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

```bash
echo "Default JAVA" $JAVA_HOME

echo "OpenJDK 8" $JAVA_HOME_8_X64
echo "OpenJDK 11" $JAVA_HOME_11_X64
echo "OpenJDK 17" $JAVA_HOME_17_X64
echo "OpenJDK 21" $JAVA_HOME_21_X64

# Change JAVA_HOME to OPENJDK 17
echo "JAVA_HOME=$JAVA_HOME_17_X64" >> $AC_ENV_FILE_PATH
```

Create a custom script like above and put it **above** your [Android Build](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build) step.

<Screenshot url="https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/workflow-android-change-java-workflow-detail.png" />

:::caution

Please be aware that this custom script affects any step that comes after.

Therefore, you should use this step as a standalone step instead of as part of any custom script.

:::tip

You can find more details about the included Java versions on the [Android Build Infrastructure](/infrastructure/android-build-infrastructure#java-version) page.

:::info

#### Changing System Java Version

Changing the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable will be enough for your Android builds, but it won't change the `java` version in the system.

If you're using a tool in the build pipeline that requires another Java version than the default OpenJDK 11, you should also change the system's default Java version using the below commands in the custom script.

```bash
source "$SDKMAN_DIR/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
sdk default java $(basename $JAVA_HOME_17_X64)
```

After that, you will see the output of `java -version` as below in the build logs.

```txt
openjdk version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu17.42+19-CA (build 17.0.7+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu17.42+19-CA (build 17.0.7+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

You can also switch to other pre-installed Java versions using the relevant environment variable as an argument in the `sdk` command. For more details about these environment variables, see the [Android Build Infrastructure](/infrastructure/android-build-infrastructure#java-version) page.

### How to install a new package to the build machine?

You can use the compatible package managers to install packages.

For the macOS build machines for iOS builds, \_brew \_is a commonly used package manager with commands like `brew install maven`

For the Linux (Debian) build machines for Android builds, _apt-get_ can be used for 3rd party packages such as `apt-get -y install maven`

### How to change the package name/application ID dynamically?

With custom scripts, you can edit the Info.plist and the build.gradle files.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```bash title="iOS sample for Info.plist"
cd $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR/Your-Target-Folder
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleIdentifier io.myapp" "./Info.plist"
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="android" label="Android">

```bash title="Android sample for build.gradle"
cd $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR/app
sed -i '' 's/old-value/new-value/g' build.gradle
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### How to access a file in the repository directory?

For each step in the workflow, you can view the input and output variables in the step configuration.

The repository directory is an output of the Git Clone step and its patch can be accessed with the `AC_REPOSITORY_PATH` environment variable by any step added after the Git Clone step. An example is as follows:

```bash
cd $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR
cat README
```

### How to a add a file as a downloadable build artifact?

You can add any file to the output directory that contain the build artifacts using the `AC_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable. An example is as follows:

```bash
cd $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR/app/build/reports/
mv lint-results* $AC_OUTPUT_DIR/
```

### How to break pipeline on low test coverage

This document provides a sample custom script written in Ruby that can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to enforce a minimum test coverage threshold. The script is designed to break the pipeline if the covered test result falls below a specified percentage.

:::danger
Please note that this custom script must be placed after the [**Test Reports**](https://docs.appcircle.io/continuous-testing/android-testing/running-android-unit-tests#generating-test-report) step in the workflow.
:::

```ruby
require 'json'

def env_has_key(key)
    !ENV[key].nil? && ENV[key] != '' ? ENV[key] : abort("Missing #{key}.")
end

output_dir = env_has_key('AC_OUTPUT_DIR')

def read_json_file(test_result_file_path)
  JSON.parse(File.read(test_result_file_path))
end

def extract_line_coverage(json_data)
  json_data['coverage']['lineCoverage']
end

begin
test_result_file_path = "#{output_dir}/test_results.json"
json_data = read_json_file(test_result_file_path)
line_coverage = extract_line_coverage(json_data)

puts "Current Line Coverage: % #{line_coverage * 100}"

min_coverage = 2.0
puts "Minimum coverage percentage: #{min_coverage}"

if (line_coverage * 100) < min_coverage
    puts "Coverage is #{line_coverage} and below minimum coverage percentage given #{min_coverage}. \nExiting."
    exit (1)
else
    puts "Coverage is above the threshold. It is clear."
end

rescue StandardError => e
  puts "An error occurred: #{e.message}"
end
```

:::info

Please feel free to edit the following variables according to your own requirements:

- `test_result_file_path`: The file path of the test result file from which to retrieve the covered percentage value.
- `min_coverage`: The minimum percentage required for the pipeline to continue without breaking.

### How to use environment variables along with the `sudo` command?

Both user-created and Appcircle-reserved [environment variables](/environment-variables/managing-variables) can be used within a custom script with any required command. But, by default, commands that are triggered with `sudo`Â will not reach them since the user scope is changed.

In order to use all user environment variables with `sudo`, you should add the `-E` argument to the `sudo` command. The `-E` (preserve environment) option indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their existing environment variables.

For instance, you can check the list of environment variables in the build pipeline using the command below.

```bash
sudo -E printenv
```

### How can I send a custom Email?

Appcircle provides a **ready-to-use email** structure in the [**Testing Distribution**](/testing-distribution/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile#share-binary), and [**Publish**](/publish-integrations/common-publish-integrations/get-approval-via-email) modules. This structure varies across the two modules. If desired, the user can customize this structure by using the [**Custom Script**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/custom-script) below to send their own custom email.

The following Bash script is set to use a **Gmail SMTP Server**. For more information, please visit [**Gmail SMTP Server**](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en) documentation. 

```bash

# Set SMTP server 
CS_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"

:::info Script Execution

This script is written in `Bash`. When running with **Custom Script**, you need to set the `Execute With` parameter as `Bash`. For more information, please visit the [**Custom Script Input Variables**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/custom-script#input-variables) documentation section.

:::

:::tip Reciever Email Address

If you want to send an e-mail to multiple e-mail addresses instead of a single e-mail address. In the `EMAIL_TO` parameter, it will be enough to write all the addresses to send an e-mail separated by commas. For example; `EMAIL_TO=example@email.com,example2@email.com`

:::

:::caution Credentials

When using your own SMTP server credentials for the three variables below, please use Environment Variables. This prevents sensitive information, such as passwords, from being exposed to unauthorized individuals. For more detailed information, please refer to the [**Environment Variables**](/environment-variables/managing-variables) documentation.

- **$CS_EMAIL**: SMTP Server email address.
- **$CS_USERNAME**: Sender email address.
- **$CS_PASSWORD**: Sender email address password.

Otherwise, to send an email you need to have some information such as email subject, sender email, reciever email. You can use these parameters to use:

- **EMAIL_SUBJECT**: Subject of sending email
- **EMAIL_TO**: Reciever email address.
- **EMAIL_FROM**: Sender email address for visualization.
- **EMAIL_BODY**: Content of sending email.

:::

:::info Username and Password for Google SMTP Users

When you want to send an email with your Gmail account using **Google's SMTP** server, you must first **authenticate** to the Google SMTP server. For this process, you need to enter your **App Password** in the password field. 

In order to generate this password, **2FA authentication** must be turned on in your **Google account**. You can generate and retrieve this password from the **App Passwords** section under **Google Account management**. For detailed information about **App Passwords**, please visit the [**Google App Password**](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) documentation.

:::

:::tip Protocols and SMTP Host

This script uses the TLS protocol for SMTP server usage. Since the **Gmail SMTP** server is used in the script, the required protocols are pulled from **Google's SMTP** server using the `$CS_HOST` parameter. 
If you are using your own SMTP server. Don't forget to change the `$CS_HOST` value here. 

On the other hand, to change **TLS or SSL** usage, you can change the protocol by setting the `USE_TLS` or `USE_SSL` parameters in the script to `true/false`. Note that you need to change the `$CS_PORT` parameter when using **SSL and TLS**. For more information about protocols, please visit the [**Google's TLS and SSL**](https://support.google.com/a/answer/100181) documentation.

:::


:::danger Sender Email and Spoofing

To use an SMTP server, this script first installs the necessary certificates, then authenticates to the server with the required credentials and sends the prepared email content to the recipient's email address. In order to change the sender's email address, the SMTP server must allow it by providing the necessary permissions. Otherwise, SMTP servers will send the email using the authenticated email address to prevent spoofing (impersonating someone else).

### How can I send the Appcircle build log to another platform?

To send your build log to another platform using an API, you can access the log in your workflow through `$AC_LOGFILE`.

Here is an example using Dropbox's [file-upload](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation#files-upload) API. Replace it with the appropriate API for your platform. If you are going to use DropBox, you can follow the document below to obtain the access token:
- [Generate an access token for your own account](https://dropbox.tech/developers/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account)

:::danger

Ensure sensitive data, like access tokens, are defined as private environment variables. Learn more:
- [Adding key and text-based value pairs](/environment-variables/managing-variables#adding-key-and-text-based-value-pairs)

:::

```bash
current_datetime=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")
dropbox_log_filename="/home/appcircle-logs/ac-log-$current_datetime.txt"

curl -X POST https://content.dropboxapi.com/2/files/upload \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer $DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    --header "Dropbox-API-Arg: {\"autorename\":false,\"mode\":\"add\",\"mute\":false,\"path\":\"$dropbox_log_filename\",\"strict_conflict\":false}" \
    --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
    --data-binary @"$AC_LOGFILE"

```
This script generates a timestamped log file (e.g., `ac-log-2024-10-01-14-55.txt`) in the `/home/appcircle-logs` in Dropbox.

<Screenshot url="https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/workflow-custom-script-faq-1.png" />

:::caution

Ensure that the **Custom Script** step runs after the [**Export Build Artifacts**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/export-build-artifacts) step to capture the full log.
