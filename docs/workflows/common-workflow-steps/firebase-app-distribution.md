# Firebase App Distribution

[**Firebase App Distribution**](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution) is a platform provided by [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) that enables developers to distribute pre-release versions of mobile apps to testers and stakeholders. This platform streamlines the distribution of Android and iOS apps and offers features such as targeted distribution, release notes, and feedback collection.
The Appcircle **Firebase App Distribution** step enables you to efficiently distribute your mobile applications to testers and relevant parties directly from your Appcircle workflow. With this integration, you can optimize the distribution process and gather valuable feedback to iterate on your app before its public release.

:::caution

Please note that you can also distribute your app via Appcircle. Utilizing Appcircle's distribution modules enhances manageability within the platform.

- [Appcircle Enterprise App Store](/enterprise-appstore/)
- [Appcircle Publish](/publish-module/)

### Prerequisites

Below are the workflow steps required before running the **Firebase App Distribution** step, listed with their reasons. Prerequisites vary by platform:

#### For Android (Java / Kotlin and React Native) 

| Prerequisite Workflow Step        | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Android Build**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build) | Generates the app required for the **Firebase App Distribution** step.                                                                           |
| [**Android Sign**](/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-sign)   | Required for signing the app; processes the app for signing. This step can be skipped if the app is already signed. |
