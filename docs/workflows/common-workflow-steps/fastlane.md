# Fastlane

Appcircle supports [**Fastlane**](https://fastlane.tools/) for build automation as a supplementary feature to Appcircle's own build automation.

With Appcircle, you can automate your build and signing processes with the flexible workflow structure, and you can also use Fastlane as a workflow step within the build workflows.

### Prerequisites

The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the Fastlane workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Git Clone](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone) | The repo needs to be cloned in order to start the Fastlane process. After the clone, Fastlane will be installed. After this step works, the variable `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` will be created. |

:::caution
Fastlane needs project files to work. If there is no **Git Clone** step in your workflow, it will give an error because it cannot find the relevant files of the project.
