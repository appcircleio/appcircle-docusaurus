# Fastlane

Appcircle supports [**Fastlane**](https://fastlane.tools/) for build automation as a supplementary feature to Appcircle's own build automation.

With Appcircle, you can automate your build and signing processes with the flexible workflow structure, and you can also use Fastlane as a workflow step within the build workflows.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Fastlane** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [**Git Clone**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone) | The repo needs to be cloned in order to start the Fastlane process. After the clone, Fastlane will be installed. After this step works, the variable `$AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` will be created. |

:::caution

Fastlane needs project files to work. If there is no **Git Clone** step in your workflow, it will give an error because it cannot find the relevant files of the project.

:::

### Input Variables

This step contains some input variable(s). It needs these variable(s) to work. The table below gives explanation for this variable(s).

| Variable Name                            | Description                         | Status           |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| `$AC_FASTLANE_DIR`            | This path is Fastlane's path in the project. By default, it is `$AC_REPOSITORY_DIR`. If your Fastlane file is in a different location in the repo, please change it. | Required |
| `$AC_FASTLANE_LANE`           | Fastlane lane. For example: `android deploy` or `ios release`. | Required |

## FAQ

### How to run a Fastlane plug-in directly? 

With Appcircle's Fastlane integration, you can easily run the [lane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/advanced/lanes/) you want with the Fastfile in your project. But you can also run a [Fastlane plugins](https://rubygems.org/search?query=fastlane-plugin-) directly in the pipeline without any Fastlane integration.

You can easily add the [Fastlane plugins](https://rubygems.org/search?query=fastlane-plugin-) you want to run, which are not included in your Fastfile and are available on the Fastlane plugins, to the pipeline via a [**Custom Script**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/custom-script) and run them easily. For all available plugins, please visit the [**Fastlane plugins**](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/available-plugins/) documentation.

The example `Bash` script below shows how to run the Fastlane plugin with a gem file.  In this example, `fastlane-plugin-json` is used as a Fastlane plugin. Add a **Custom Script** step to your [**Workflows**](/workflows) to run the following script.


```bash

cd $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR
gem install fastlane-plugin-json
echo "gem 'fastlane-plugin-json'" >> Gemfile
fastlane run read_json json_path:./example.json

```

The same command sequence should be used to run different Fastlane plugins. Once the plugin is installed, it is run with the `fastlane run` command. The necessary actions must be completed for the plugin to work correctly. The command used to run Fastlane plugin is as follows:

```bash

fastlane run [action] parameter:value

```

- `Action`: The plugin will be run.
- `Parameter`: Input parameter expected by the plugin.
- `Value`: Input value to be entered.

If the plugin you are using contains more than one parameter, you can use the parameters side by side as below.

```bash

fastlane run [action] parameter1:value1 parameter2:value2

```

For plugin details and the actions they contain, visit the repository of the [**Fastlane plugins**](https://docs.fastlane.tools/plugins/available-plugins/).
