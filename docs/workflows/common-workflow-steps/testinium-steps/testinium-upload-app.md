# Testinium Upload App

The **Testinium Upload App** step integrates the [Testinium](https://testinium.com/) testing platform into Appcircle's CI/CD workflow, allowing developers to upload mobile applications seamlessly to Testinium. This step serves as a prerequisite for executing test plans, enabling efficient and automated testing directly within the Appcircle environment.

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Testinium Upload App** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

<TestiniumEnterpriseWhitelistDanger />

:::info

After uploading the application, you should use the [**Testinium Run Test Plan**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/testinium-steps/testinium-run-test-plan) step to run the test plan and view the test report. If you prefer to perform both operations within the same step, use the [**Testinium**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/testinium-steps/testinium) step instead.
