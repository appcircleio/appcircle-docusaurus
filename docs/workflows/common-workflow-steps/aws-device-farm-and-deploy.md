# AWS Device Farm and Deploy

[AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/) is an application testing service that enables you to run your tests concurrently on multiple mobile devices to speed up the execution of your tests and generates videos and logs to help you quickly identify issues with your app.

Appcircle is integrated with the AWS Device Farm for continuous testing. You can build your app in Appcircle and deploy it directly to AWS Device Farm to run automated tests.

With the **AWS Device Farm Deploy and Run** step in Appcircle, you can directly deploy your binaries and test scripts during the build to the specified AWS Device Farm project and run tests.

The full details of the tests are accessible in the [AWS Device Farm console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/).

### Prerequisites

This component works separately for iOS and Android. It depends on different steps for both platforms.

:::caution

Pay attention to the dependent step on whichever platform you are working on.

| [Android Build for UI Testing](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build-for-ui-testing)      | The Android Build for UI Testing workflow step is tailored to build your Android test application using Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) for the designated architectures outlined in your project. |
| [Xcodebuild Build for Testing](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/build-and-test/xcodebuild-for-testing) | This step builds your application and generates an IPA for testing so that it can be used in test automation frameworks.                                                                    |

#### How to get the ARN values

To get the ARN values, you first need to install the AWS CLI. Please refer to the guide for your operating system to install it: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)

Once the CLI is installed, first run the following command to list the projects and get the project ARN:

```bash
aws devicefarm list-projects
```

You can then get the ARN of the device pools of a specific project as follows. Replace `MyProjectARN` with the project ARN obtained from the previous command.

```bash
aws devicefarm list-device-pools --arn MyProjectARN
```

For the details of the other AWS Device Farm-specific parameters, please refer to the following documents:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/devicefarm/create-upload.html

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/devicefarm/schedule-run.html

After you save your settings, you can run the build and the step will be executed accordingly. You can view the details of the AWS Device Farm Deploy and Run step in the build logs:
