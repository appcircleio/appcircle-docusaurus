# Cocoapods Install

Runs the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) install command for dependency management. This step installs all pod dependencies. Appcircle uses the `pod install` command to install pods in the project. This command comes from the CocoaPods tool installed on the system. If a version is not specified for CocoaPods, this step will use the version of [**CocoaPods installed**](https://docs.appcircle.io/infrastructure/ios-build-infrastructure#ios-build-agent-stacks) on the system.

### Prerequisites

The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the **Cocoapods Install** workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Git Clone](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) | The repo needs to be cloned in order to start the CocoaPods installation process. After the clone, CocoaPods will be installed. After this step works, the variable `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` will be created. |

| Variable Name           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Status   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `$AC_PROJECT_PATH`      | Specifies the project path. For example: `./appcircle.xcodeproj`. If you filled in **`Configuration => Project or Workspace`**, this variable comes from [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration). | Required |
| `$AC_REPOSITORY_DIR`    | Specifies the cloned repository directory. This path will be generated after the [Git Clone](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps#git-clone) step.                                                                                         | Required |
| `$AC_COCOAPODS_VERSION` | Specifies the CocoaPods version. If there is a specific version you want to use, give it here as hardcoded, and the system will automatically install the given version.                                                                                        | Optional |

:::info
Please note that the CocoaPods Install step uses the default system [**CocoaPods version**](https://docs.appcircle.io/infrastructure/ios-build-infrastructure#ios-build-agent-stacks). If you want to use a specific version, please enter it hardcoded in the CocoaPods Version parameter in the step.
:::

:::danger
Remember, if the project extension is not **.xcworkpace**, the pod install step will not work as expected. In the Configuration tab, make sure that the extension in the project path is **.xcworkspace**.
