# Azure Bot for Swiftlint

With the Azure DevOps Bot for Swiftlint integration, you can analyze your [**SwiftLint**](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/) and post the report details under the opened PR. You can also modify the PR status.

:::info
This component will work in builds that are automatically triggered by a configured trigger. To achieve this, you need to open a PR and set up the trigger. Further information for **Trigger Build**, please follow the [documantation](/build/build-process-management/build-manually-or-with-triggers/).
:::

:::caution
If there are warnings or errors in the SwiftLint report, this workflow step will fail and stop the build.
:::

:::danger
For this component to work, a PR must be opened, and a trigger must be set up based on this PR. If the build is triggered manually, the component will not function.
