# Test Reports for iOS

The Appcircle **Test Report** step displays your test results and code coverage in an aesthetically pleasing user interface.

This component supports the following test and coverage formats:

- [Xcode 13+ XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest) - For Apple's native test framework.
- [JUnit](https://junit.org) - For Java-based test reporting.

| [**Xcodebuild for Unit and UI Test**](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/xcodebuild-for-unit-and-ui-test) | Run unit and UI tests in your project to generate an `.xcresult` file containing the test outcomes. |
