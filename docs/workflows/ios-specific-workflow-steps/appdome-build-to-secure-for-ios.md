# Appdome Build-2Secure for iOS

[Appdome Build-2Secure](https://apis.appdome.com/docs/integrate-in-cicd) automates the integration of advanced security features, adaptive protections, code-signing, and certification processes into mobile applications, enhancing security without the need for manual coding or code analysis.

For detailed information on the benefits that **Appdome Build-2Secure** adds to your mobile app, please refer to the following blog post:

### Prerequisites

The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the **Appdome Build-2Secure for iOS** workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                                             | Description                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Xcodebuild for Devices](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/xcodebuild-for-devices) | The app required for this step is generated by the **Xcodebuild for Devices** (or alternative build steps). |

:::danger
If a step other than the **Xcodebuild for Devices** step is used to build or sign the app, then the **Appdome Build-2Secure for iOS** step depends on this step.
