# Tuist

[**Tuist**](https://docs.tuist.io/) is a command-line tool that abstracts the intricacies of Xcode projects through project generation. It serves as a foundation to help teams maintain and optimize their large modular projects.

You can seamlessly integrate Tuist into your workflow with Appcircle, making setup and utilization within your existing development processes easy.

### Prerequisites

Before you run the **Tuist** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Git Clone](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone) | You need to clone the repository to start the Tuist process. After cloning, the system installs Tuist and creates the `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` variable.  |
