# Xcodebuild for Devices (Archive & Export)

This step builds your application for iOS devices in ARM architecture, which is required for the [**Sharing With Testers**](/testing-distribution/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile) feature or any other means of iOS distribution.

:::info

This step is the archive and export step. When the step is completed, the `.ipa` file of the application is generated.

:::

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Xcodebuild for Devices** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Require Workflow Step                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Git Clone**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone)                      | The repository that needs to be built must be fetched from the Git provider. **Xcodebuild for Devices** should be used after this step.                                             |
| [**Xcode Select**](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/xcode-select)   | In this step, select the Xcode version to build. **Xcodebuild for Devices** should be used after this step.                                                                         |
| [**Cocoapods Install**](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/cocoapods-install) | This step installs all pod dependencies for project. **Xcodebuild for Devices** should be used after this step. If you use SPM (Swift Package Manager), it is not necessary to use. |

:::danger

This step should always follow steps that may affect Archive and Export, such as **Xcode Select** and **Cocoapods Install**.

:::info Local SPM (Swift Package Manager)

If SPM dependencies are kept locally in your project and are already installed, the Xcodebuild for Devices step may fail during the build while resolving the dependencies. For this reason, you can use the `-skipPackagePluginValidation` parameter in the `$AC_ARCHIVE_FLAGS` input to prevent reloading dependencies that are already installed in the project.

**Note**: This may be a security risk if they are not from trusted sources.

## FAQ

### Adding Additional Command to Xcodebuild for Devices Step

To address the need to add a new command after completing the `xcodebuild` command in the **Xcodebuild for Devices** step, you can follow the following approach:

- Disable **Xcodebuild for Devices** step in your workflow.
- Add a new "Custom Script" component instead of **Xcodebuild for Devices** step.
- Go to Appcircle github profile and navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/appcircleio/appcircle-ios-build-sign-component).
- Copy all code lines from the `main.rb` file and paste them into the new **Custom Script** that you just added in your workflow.
- Change the name as **Custom Xcodebuild for Devices** for this custom script.
- Change "Execute With" picker as **Ruby**.
- In the Ruby code, you can add the required codes to the end of the `xcodebuild` command.

:::caution

Before running the script, some variables must be changed, and new variables must be added to the **Custom Script**.

:::

First, the `output_path` global variable should be changed like below in global variables.

```ruby
...
## Other global variables
...
$output_path = env_has_key("AC_OUTPUT_DIR")
```

After this, you need to add some parameters to your custom script. The parameters below should be added right after global variables.

```ruby
AC_COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE = "NO"
AC_METHOD_FOR_EXPORT = "auto-detect"
AC_DELETE_ARCHIVE = "false"
AC_ARCHIVE_PATH = "AC_ARCHIVE_PATH"
AC_ARCHIVE_METADATA_PATH = "AC_ARCHIVE_METADATA_PATH"
AC_EXPORT_DIR = "AC_EXPORT_DIR"
```
In the next step for completing custom script settings, the `AC_COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE` parameter should be equaled with the following parameter:

```ruby
$compiler_index_store_enable = AC_COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE
```

:::caution

You should find the line with `compiler_index_store_enable` and replace it with the above statement.

:::

After these variables were set. There is an `archive()` function in the Ruby code. First, find the function in the code.

```ruby
## Archive Functions
def archive()
  extname = File.extname($project_path)
  command = "xcodebuild -scheme \"#{$scheme}\" clean archive -archivePath \"#{$archive_path}\" -derivedDataPath \"#{$temporary_path}/DerivedData\" -destination \"generic/platform=iOS\""
  ...
  ## Other code lines of archive() function
  ...
```
At the end of this function, before running the `run_command_simple()` function, you can add these lines to be able to add additional commands.

```ruby
  ...
  ## Other code lines of archive() function
  ...
  command.concat(" ")
  command.concat("Write your command that you want to add here")
  command.concat(" ")

  run_command_simple(command)
end
```

#### For Example

When you need to reduce the verbosity of the `xcodebuild` logs, you can achieve this by appending the `| grep -A 5 error:` command to the `xcodebuild` command to decrease the clutter in the log file.

```ruby
  ...
  ## Other code lines of archive() function
  ...
  command.concat(" ")
  command.concat(" | grep -A 5 error:")
  command.concat(" ")

  run_command_simple(command)
end
```

Now, the `run_command_simple()` function will execute your customized `xcodebuild` command.

### How can I resolve the `Outputting Keys and Certificates` signing error?

Since Appcircle does not have direct access to self-hosted environments, the default versions installed on runners may also have user-generated updates. This error is caused by using **OpenSSL** by default instead of **LibreSSL**. If **OpenSSL** is used instead of **LibreSSL** for any reason in your self-hosted environments, you will get an **error** like the one below.

```
`parse_certificate': Error outputting keys and certificates (RuntimeError)
C05EDAE401000000:error:0308010C:digital envelope routines:inner_evp_generic_fetch:unsupported:crypto/evp/evp_fetch.c:355:Global default library context, Algorithm (RC2-40-CBC : 0), Properties ()
Could not find certificate from <stdin>
Error: Error outputting keys and certificates
C05EDAE401000000:error:0308010C:digital envelope routines:inner_evp_generic_fetch:unsupported:crypto/evp/evp_fetch.c:355:Global default library context, Algorithm (RC2-40-CBC : 0), Properties ()
```

:::info Cloud Customers

All packages running in Appcircle cloud environments are controlled by the Appcircle development teams on runners and updated when necessary. One of the packages used on runners is **LibreSSL**. In Appcircle Cloud environments, the **LibreSSL** 3.3.6 version on macOS Sonoma and the **LibreSSL** 2.8.3 version on macOS Monterey are used. For more information, please visit our [**Build Infrastructure**](/infrastructure/ios-build-infrastructure#ios-build-environment) documentation.

However, issues may still occur depending on how the environment is used. If you are working in the cloud environment and the [**Custom Scripts**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/custom-script) you use can **change** or **update** the packages in our environments. If cloud users encounter such **signing errors**, it is recommended to check the **Custom Scripts** used. You can use the example `bash` script below.

```bash
export PATH="/usr/bin:$PATH"

```

Appcircle's macOS environments use `LibreSSL` by default. If this default value is changed in any way, the global path must be updated with the script above and `LibreSSL` must be set as default again. Otherwise, the system will try to find and sign `OpenSSL` first while the system is running, so if there is a depricated method, it may cause an error during signing.

**Note:** Please note, the example script given above should be run before the **Xcodebuild for Devices** step. Otherwise you may keep getting errors during signing.

:::

Although **LibreSSL** and **OpenSSL** are alternatives to each other, there are differences between them. **LibreSSL** comes by default with macOS machines and is managed by **Apple**. For this reason, since Appcircle does not have direct access to self-hosted environments, some user-side work on runners can replace **LibreSSL** with **OpenSSL** or update their versions.

The reason for this **error** is that the **encryption algorithm** in the new versions of **OpenSSL** has been changed. In **OpenSSL** versions **3 and above**, the algorithm named **RC2** is marked as **legacy**. When you encounter this error, you need to change the **OpenSSL** package on the runners receiving the error to **LibreSSL**. 

The **RC2 algorithm** is just one example. There are other algorithms and ciphers that **OpenSSL** has deprecated. Users may encounter other errors with certificates containing other algorithms, such as **SHA1**. This depends on the encryption algorithm of the certificate the user is using.

For more information about **legacy algorithms**, please visit the [**OpenSSL**](https://docs.openssl.org/3.0/man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-legacy/) documentation.
