# Xcodebuild for Devices (Archive & Export)

This step builds your application for iOS devices in ARM architecture, which is required for the [**Sharing With Testers**](/testing-distribution/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile) feature or any other means of iOS distribution.

:::info

This step is the archive and export step. When the step is completed, the `.ipa` file of the application is generated.

:::

### Prerequisites

Before running the **Xcodebuild for Devices** step, you must complete certain prerequisites, as detailed in the table below:

| Require Workflow Step                                                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Git Clone**](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/git-clone)                      | The repository that needs to be built must be fetched from the Git provider. **Xcodebuild for Devices** should be used after this step.                                             |
| [**Xcode Select**](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/xcode-select)   | In this step, select the Xcode version to build. **Xcodebuild for Devices** should be used after this step.                                                                         |
| [**Cocoapods Install**](/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/cocoapods-install) | This step installs all pod dependencies for project. **Xcodebuild for Devices** should be used after this step. If you use SPM (Swift Package Manager), it is not necessary to use. |

:::danger

This step should always follow steps that may affect Archive and Export, such as **Xcode Select** and **Cocoapods Install**.

## FAQ

### Adding Additional Command to Xcodebuild for Devices Step

To address the need to add a new command after completing the `xcodebuild` command in the **Xcodebuild for Devices** step, you can follow the following approach:

- Disable **Xcodebuild for Devices** step in your workflow.
- Add a new "Custom Script" component instead of **Xcodebuild for Devices** step.
- Go to Appcircle github profile and navigate to the [repository](https://github.com/appcircleio/appcircle-ios-build-sign-component).
- Copy all code lines from the `main.rb` file and paste them into the new **Custom Script** that you just added in your workflow.
- Change the name as **Custom Xcodebuild for Devices** for this custom script.
- Change "Execute With" picker as **Ruby**.
- In the Ruby code, you can add the required codes to the end of the `xcodebuild` command.

:::caution

Before running the script, some variables must be changed, and new variables must be added to the **Custom Script**.

:::

First, the `output_path` global variable should be changed like below in global variables.

```ruby
...
## Other global variables
...
$output_path = env_has_key("AC_OUTPUT_DIR")
```

After this, you need to add some parameters to your custom script. The parameters below should be added right after global variables.

```ruby
AC_COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE = "NO"
AC_METHOD_FOR_EXPORT = "auto-detect"
AC_DELETE_ARCHIVE = "false"
AC_ARCHIVE_PATH = "AC_ARCHIVE_PATH"
AC_ARCHIVE_METADATA_PATH = "AC_ARCHIVE_METADATA_PATH"
AC_EXPORT_DIR = "AC_EXPORT_DIR"
```
In the next step for completing custom script settings, the `AC_COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE` parameter should be equaled with the following parameter:

```ruby
$compiler_index_store_enable = AC_COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE
```

:::caution

You should find the line with `compiler_index_store_enable` and replace it with the above statement.

:::

After these variables were set. There is an `archive()` function in the Ruby code. First, find the function in the code.

```ruby
## Archive Functions
def archive()
  extname = File.extname($project_path)
  command = "xcodebuild -scheme \"#{$scheme}\" clean archive -archivePath \"#{$archive_path}\" -derivedDataPath \"#{$temporary_path}/DerivedData\" -destination \"generic/platform=iOS\""
  ...
  ## Other code lines of archive() function
  ...
```
At the end of this function, before running the `run_command_simple()` function, you can add these lines to be able to add additional commands.

```ruby
  ...
  ## Other code lines of archive() function
  ...
  command.concat(" ")
  command.concat("Write your command that you want to add here")
  command.concat(" ")

  run_command_simple(command)
end
```

#### For Example

When you need to reduce the verbosity of the `xcodebuild` logs, you can achieve this by appending the `| grep -A 5 error:` command to the `xcodebuild` command to decrease the clutter in the log file.

```ruby
  ...
  ## Other code lines of archive() function
  ...
  command.concat(" ")
  command.concat(" | grep -A 5 error:")
  command.concat(" ")

  run_command_simple(command)
end
```

Now, the `run_command_simple()` function will execute your customized `xcodebuild` command.
