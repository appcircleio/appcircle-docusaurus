# Xcode Select (Version)

This step is used to specify the Xcode version to be used during the build process. All available versions of Xcode can be seen in the [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration) tab.

### Prerequisites

:::danger
Always use this step **before** [**CocoaPods Install**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/#cocoapods-install) and [**Xcodebuild for Devices**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/#xcodebuild-for-devices-archive--export). If you have other **Xcode related** steps, such as [**Xcodebuild for iOS Simulators**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/#xcodebuild-for-ios-simulator) and [**Xcodebuild for Unit and UI Tests**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps/#xcodebuild-for-unit-and-ui-tests), **don't forget** to use before them.
:::

:::caution
Please **don't forget** to select the **Xcode version** from [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/building-ios-applications#build-configuration) first.

:::info
Appcircle provides new versions of Xcode (including beta versions) within 24 hours after they are released.

### Pool-Based Xcode Version Selection

A version other than the Xcode versions on the configuration page should not be entered manually as the Xcode select workflow argument.
Because the Xcode versions on the configuration page are the versions installed on runners.
Entering an unavailable Xcode version may cause the build to fail.
You can review the documentation for detailed information about the Xcode version selection [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/self-hosted-runner/configure-runner/manage-pools/#pool-based-xcode-version-selection).
