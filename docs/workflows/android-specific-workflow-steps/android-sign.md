# Android Sign

**Android Sign** step signs your *APK* or *AAB* with the given Android *keystore* and exports a binary file compatible with Android devices.

:::info
This step follows the [**Android Build**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps#android-build) step to sign the unsigned build output if the project doesn't include a *keystore*. If your project includes a *keystore*, the build application step will generate a signed artifact. If you do not disable this step, your artifact will be unsigned and then re-signed using the *keystore* selected in the **Configuration** or in this step.
:::

### Prerequisites
The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the **Android Build** workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [Git Clone](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) | This step relies on the **Android Build** step and the **Git Clone** step is necessary for the **Android Build** step to run successfully. |
| [Android Build](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps#android-build) | The app required for this step is generated by the **Android Build** (or alternative build steps). |

:::caution
If a step other than the **Android Build** step is used to build an app, then the **Android Sign** step depends on this step.

:::danger
To share the signed apps created as an output of this step or to view them on the **Download Artifacts** page, please ensure that the [**Export Build Artifacts**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#export-build-artifacts) step is included in your workflow after this step.

### Input Variables
For each component, specific input variables are required for its operation on your system. The input variables necessary for the **Android Sign** are as follows:

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/android-workflow-components-android-sign_1.png' alt="image1" />

| Variable Name               | Description                                  | Status |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------|
| `$AC_APK_PATH` | The path of the *APK* file. This path is automatically generated in the **Android Build** step. You may need to modify this input variable to provide a different path. | Required |
| `$AC_AAB_PATH` | The path of the *AAB* file. This path is automatically generated in the **Android Build** step. You may need to modify this input variable to provide a different path. | Required |
| `$AC_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH` | *Keystore* file can be selected in the **Configuration**. This value will be auto-generated depending on your *keystore* file selection in [signing configuration on Appcircle](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/building-android-applications#signing). | Required |
| `$AC_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Password for the selected *keystore* file. This value will be auto-generated based on your *keystore* file selection. | Required |
| `$AC_ANDROID_ALIAS` | Alias name for the selected *keystore* file. This value will be auto-generated depending on your **Configuration** |
| `$AC_ANDROID_ALIAS_PASSWORD` | Alias password for the selected *keystore* file. This value will be auto-generated depending on your **Configuration** |
| `$AC_V2_SIGN` | Defaults to false. Set true if the signature should be done using apksigner instead of jarsigner. For more information, [Apps targeting Android 11 require APK Signature Scheme v2](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/behavior-changes-11#minimum-signature-scheme). | Optional |

### Output Variables
The outputs that can result from the operation of this component are listed as follows.

| Variable Name          | Description                                 |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `$AC_SIGNED_APK_PATH`  | Path for the signed *APK* file output. If an *APK* file is provided as input, the signed app will also be in *APK* format. |
| `$AC_SIGNED_AAB_PATH`  | Path for the signed App Bundle file output. If an *AAB* file is provided as input, the signed app will also be in *AAB* format. |

:::tip
If both input value types (*AAB* and *APK*) are provided, the same type of signed app will be generated for both.
