# App Center Android Distribute

[App Center Distribute for Android](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/sdk/distribute/android) enables developers to distribute their Android applications to testers and stakeholders for testing purposes. It provides a centralised dashboard where developers can upload their app packages, manage distribution to specific groups of testers, collect feedback, and monitor installation and usage metrics. With App Center Distribute, developers can streamline the testing process, gather valuable insights, and iterate on their apps before releasing them to the public.

The Appcircle **App Center Android Distribute** step allows you to seamlessly distribute your Android applications and mapping files to [App Center](https://appcenter.ms).

:::caution
Please note that you can also distribute your app via Appcircle. Utilizing Appcircle's distribution modules enhances manageability within the platform.

For more details, please refer to the following links:

- [Appcircle Testing Distribution](https://docs.appcircle.io/distribute/)
- [Appcircle Enterprise App Store](https://docs.appcircle.io/enterprise-app-store/)
- [Appcircle Publish](https://docs.appcircle.io/publish-module/)

### Prerequisites

The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the **App Center Android Distribute** workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [**Android Build**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-build) | The app required for this step is generated by the Android Build (or alternative build steps).                                                                           |
| [**Android Sign**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/android-specific-workflow-steps/android-sign)   | If you intend to use a signed app, this step must be executed beforehand to process the output. If your app is already signed in the build step, you can skip this step. |

:::danger

If a step other than the **Android Build** or **Android Sign** step is used to build or sign the app, then the **App Center Android Distribute** step depends on this step.
