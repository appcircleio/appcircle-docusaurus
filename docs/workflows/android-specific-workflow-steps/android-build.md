# Android Build

The Appcircle Android Build step is designed to build your Android application for the architectures specified in your project.

### Prerequisites

The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the **Android Build** workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Git Clone](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) | To initiate the Android build process, the repository that needs to be built must be fetched from the branch. This is achieved as follows: Upon completion of the Git Clone step, it generates the `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` variable, which is then used as the input for the Android Build step. |

### Input Variables

For each component, specific input variables are required for its operation on your system. The input variables necessary for the **Android Build** are as follows:

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/android-workflow-components-android-build_2.png' alt="image2" />

| Variable Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Status   |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `$AC_REPOSITORY_DIR`          | This variable represents the path of the cloned Git repository. If this step runs after the [Git Clone](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) step, the variable will be automatically populated.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Required |
| `$AC_MODULE`                  | This variable specifies the project module to be build. This variable can also be set via the build [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration/). In Android Studio, you can locate the available modules for your project. For more information, please refer to [this Android document](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects#ApplicationModules). | Required |
| `$AC_VARIANTS`                | This variable specifies the project variant to be build. This variable can also be set via the build [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration/). In Android Studio, you can find the available variants for your project. For more information, please refer to this [Android document](https://developer.android.com/build/build-variants).               | Required |
| `$AC_OUTPUT_TYPE`             | This variable specifies the output type for your build file (APK or AAB). This variable can also be set via the build [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration/).                                                                                                                                                                                          | Required |
| `$AC_PROJECT_PATH`            | Specifies the project path. If your project that needs to be built is **not located** in the root directory where it was cloned from Git, you should provide the subpath as a relative path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Optional |
| `$AC_GRADLE_BUILD_EXTRA_ARGS` | Extra arguments were passed to build task. For more information, please refer to [this Gradle document](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/writing_build_scripts.html#sec:extra_properties).                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Optional |

:::info
If you have filled in the necessary variables in the **Configuration** section, you will not need to redefine these variables again in the Workflow. For more information about configurations, refer to the [Build Profile Configuration Overview](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration) document. The information you fill in the configuration will be used as input in the Android Build step. Please replace the example information with your own details:

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/android-workflow-components-android-build_1.png' alt="Configuration Image" />

1. The input corresponding to the 1st field: `$AC_MODULE`
2. The input corresponding to the 2nd field: `$AC_VARIANTS`
3. The input corresponding to the 3rd field: `$AC_OUTPUT_TYPE`
:::

:::tip
If you are using Gradle 4.3 and above in your project, you can just use the `--scan` flag in the build step to enable build scans. For existing projects, you may need to add the Gradle Scan (Gradle Enterprise) plugin. For more information, please refer to https://scans.gradle.com/

### Output Variables

The outputs that can result from the operation of this component are listed as follows:

| Variable Name  | Description                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$AC_APK_PATH` | Path for the generated **APK** file. This path will be created after the **Android Build** step runs.                        |
| `$AC_AAB_PATH` | Path for the generated **AAB** file. This path will be created after the Android Build step runs and when `AAB` is selected. |

The resulting files will be either APK or AAB, depending on whether you choose the Android App in the project [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration).

If your project has the [signing configuration](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-tips#sign-your-app) in Gradle, this step will generate a signed artifact.

:::caution
If you do not disable the **Android Sign** step and your project has no signing configuration defined in Gradle, your artifact will remain unsigned.

So, in order to sign your app using the keystore selected in the build configuration, you should enable the **Android Sign** step after **Android Build**.
