# Android Dependency Report

The **Android Dependency Report** workflow step visualizes the whole dependency tree for every [configuration](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations) available in the project.

Rendering the dependency tree is particularly useful if youâ€™d like to identify which dependencies have been resolved at runtime. It also provides you with information about any dependency conflict resolution that occurred in the process and clearly indicates the selected version. The dependency report always contains declared and transitive dependencies.

### Prerequisites

The workflow steps that need to be executed before running the **Android Dependency Report** workflow step, along with their respective reasons, are listed in the table below.

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Git Clone**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) | To initiate the **Android Dependency Report** process, the repository that needs to be built must be fetched from the branch. This is achieved as follows: Upon completion of the **Git Clone** step, it generates the `AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` variable, which is then used as the input for the **Android Dependency Report** step. |

### Input Variables

For each component, specific input variables are required for its operation on your system. The input variables necessary for the **Android Dependency Report** are as follows:

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/android-workflow-components-android-dependency-report_2.png' alt="image2" />

| Variable Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Status   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `$AC_REPOSITORY_DIR`           | This variable represents the path of the cloned Git repository. If this step runs after the [Git Clone](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) step, the variable will be automatically populated.                                                                                                                                                                                      | Required |
| `$AC_MODULE`                   | This variable specifies the project module to be built. This variable can also be set via the build [Configuration](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration/). In Android Studio, you can locate the available modules for your project. For more information, please refer to this [Android document](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects#ApplicationModules). | Required |
| `$AC_DEPENDENCY_CONFIGURATION` | Specifies the [configuration](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sec:what-are-dependency-configurations) to resolve for displaying dependency information. The default value is: `implementation`.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Required |
| `$AC_PROJECT_PATH`             | Specifies the project path. If your project that needs to be built is **not located** in the root directory where it was cloned from Git, you should provide the subpath as a relative path. The default value is: `./`                                                                                                                                                                                                | Optional |
