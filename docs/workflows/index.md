A workflow is a ladder of steps taken to build your applications.

Each step has a different purpose and the workflow can be customized by modifying step parameters and inputs, running custom scripts, or re-ordering steps.

Workflows allow you to have complete control on your build process and enhance it with third-party services and features.

:::caution

Please note that modifying workflow steps may cause your builds to fail, so utmost care is recommended when editing workflows.
