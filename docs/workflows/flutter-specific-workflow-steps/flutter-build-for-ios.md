# Flutter Build for iOS

This step makes your Flutter project suitable for the iOS environment and builds it using the [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/flutter/flutter).

### Prerequisites

:::caution
Once you have compiled your app for Flutter iOS, the native environment will be built. For this reason, this step should be used before the [**Xcodebuild for Devices**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/ios-specific-workflow-steps#xcodebuild-for-devices-archive--export) step.
:::

| Prerequisite Workflow Step                      | Description                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| [**Git Clone**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/common-workflow-steps/#git-clone) | This step will clone your project through the connected Git provider and create the `$AC_REPOSITORY_DIR` variable. |
| [**Flutter Install**](https://docs.appcircle.io/workflows/flutter-specific-workflow-steps#flutter-install) | This step will install the Flutter SDK. If a version is not specified, it will install the latest **stable** version. The **Flutter SDK** package must be installed on the system. For this reason, make sure that **Flutter Build for iOS** is used after the **Flutter Install**. |

:::danger
**Keep in mind** that this step is dependent on the Flutter Install step. If Flutter is not installed on the system, it will give a Flutter SDK not found error.
