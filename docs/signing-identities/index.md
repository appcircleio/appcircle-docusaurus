# Signing Identities

The Signing Identities section is essential for configuring the credentials required to sign your iOS and Android applications. It's where you can manage and store your signing certificates for iOS and your keystores for Android.

For more information, refer to the following link:

## [Apple Certificates](/signing-identities/apple-certificates)

Manage your Apple Certificates by adding and storing your Apple Certificates and other related details required for signing iOS applications.

## [Apple Devices](/signing-identities/apple-devices)

When it comes to developing and testing iOS apps, one of the most important tasks is registering your devices with the Apple Developer portal. This is necessary so that you can install your app on those devices for testing purposes. However, this process can be a bit tedious, especially if you need to register a large number of devices. That's where Appcircle comes in.


## [Apple Identifiers](/signing-identities/apple-identifiers)

Register and Manage your Apple Identifiers by adding and storing your Apple Identifiers and other related details required for signing iOS applications.

## [Apple Profiles](/signing-identities/apple-profiles)

Register and Manage your Apple Profiles by adding and storing your Apple Profiles and other related details required for signing iOS applications.

## [Android Keystores](/signing-identities/android-keystores)

Keep your Android app signing keys secure by managing your keystores. This part of the documentation helps you understand keystore creation, management, and usage within your Android build processes.

## [Signing Reports](/signing-identities/signing-reports)

The Signing Reports section contains the list of builds selected for signing in a given time period.

## [Activity Log](/signing-identities/signing-identities-activity-log)

You can view Signing Identity module actions such as creating, deleting, and adding Apple Certificates or Android Keystores to Organizations or Sub Organizations in the Activity Log section.
