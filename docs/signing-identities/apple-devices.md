# Apple Devices

When it comes to developing and testing iOS apps, one of the most important tasks is registering your devices with the Apple Developer portal. This is necessary so that you can install your app on those devices for testing purposes. However, this process can be a bit tedious, especially if you need to register a large number of devices. That's where Appcircle comes in.

Ad-hoc distribution is a method of distributing iOS apps outside the App Store. To use Ad-hoc distribution, devices must be registered with the Apple Developer portal and included in your app's provisioning profile. Appcircle streamlines and simplifies this process, making it more efficient.

:::caution Apple Devices

Please note that Ad Hoc provisioning is intended solely for internal distribution and testing, and cannot be used for App Store submission or external distribution. The number of devices that can be registered in an Apple Developer account is **limited to 100 iOS devices**, which can only be reset once a year.

For more information, please visit [Apple Developer documentations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/devices).

## Adding Device

Appcircle's advanced Apple Devices feature simplifies device management. It allows you to fetch existing registered devices and add or register a device manually or via email.

To manage your devices, simply visit the relevant sections in the Apple Devices feature.

- **Registered Devices**: This section lists the devices registered to your Apple Developer Account using an API key.
- **Non-Registered Devices**: This section shows devices registered on Appcircle but not yet registered in your Apple Developer account. You can manually add a new device in this section.
- **Invited Users**: This section lists users who have received email invitations to provide device information. You can collect new device details via email.

Follow this document for detailed usage and purpose of all sections.

## Registered Device

In the **Registered Devices** section of Apple Devices, you can view the devices already registered in your Apple Developer account and synchronize them as needed.

:::caution Registered Devices

In order to list your registered devices, the App Store Connect API key must be added to Appcircle. Please follow the related [document](/account/my-organization/security/credentials/adding-an-app-store-connect-api-key) to add App Store Connect API key.

:::


### Fetching Registered Devices

In order to be able to list the registered devices, you must first fetch these devices using the API key. For this, you can use the ‘Get Devices from Apple Developer Portal’ button to fetch the devices with the relevant API key.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE4404New-fetch.png' />

Once the fetch process is completed successfully, the entire list of registered devices will be displayed below.

### Filtering Devices by Apple Developer Accounts

Since Appcircle's credential structure allows multiple API key connections at the same time, you can list your devices in different accounts with the account filtering feature on the registerd devices page.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE4404New-filterStore.png' />

### Filtering Devices by Device Status

Apple offers **Disable** and **Enable** options for registered devices. Disabling a device removes it from provisioning profiles and excludes it from the development process. Appcircle provides filtering options that allow you to filter devices based on their status, making it easier to manage enabled and disabled devices.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE4404New-filterStatus.png' />

### Disable Device

Apple provides a disable option to exclude registered devices from development processes. To disable a registered device on Apple, select the relevant device, and use the **Disable** button at the bottom. This process will simultaneously change the status for the relevant device registered in your Apple Developer account.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE4404New-disableDevice.png' />

:::caution Disable Device

Disabling this device will invalidate all associated provisioning profiles. You can remove this device from your account at the start of your new membership year.

:::

### Enable Device

Apple provides an enable option to include registered devices from development processes. To enable a registered device on Apple, select the relevant device, and use the **Enable** button at the bottom. This process will simultaneously change the status for the relevant device registered in your Apple Developer account.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE4404New-enableDevice.png' />

### Registering Device to different Apple Developer Portal

A device that is already registered to any Apple Developer Account can be added to different Apple accounts if desired. To do this, select the device and then register it by choosing a different API key using the Register Device to Apple Developer button in the menu that appears at the bottom.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE4404New-registerDevice.png' />

When you select different API key in the list, Appcircle will automatically register your device to selected Apple Developer Account.
