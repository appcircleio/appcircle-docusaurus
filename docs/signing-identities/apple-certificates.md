# Apple Certificates Overview

Certificate files can be in `.p12` file format as a private-public key pair. There are 2 main types of iOS certificates:

**1. Apple Development:** Used for development and testing.

The development certificates allow deploying apps to the developer devices (connected physically for testing and debugging) during the actual development process on Xcode.

The common practice is to generate this certificate automatically on Xcode, although manual generation is also available. Binaries built with a development certificate cannot be distributed.

**2. Apple Distribution:** Used for submitting applications to the App Store, or for Ad Hoc and Enterprise distribution. (Refer to the provisioning profiles section for the differences between these distribution types.)

In most cases, you will be using a distribution certificate with the combination of a provisioning profile to build and distribute apps in Appcircle.

There is a one-to-many relationship between certificates and provisioning profiles, so you may have multiple provisioning profiles associated with a single certificate.

:::info

For app builds, signing identities are not mandatory. For example, you can use unsigned apps to run on the simulator or on third-party platforms that resign your app, such as AWS Device Farm.

However, unsigned binaries cannot be installed on actual devices; therefore they cannot be used in the Appcircle Testing Distribution.

:::

You can obtain your developer certificates and provisioning profiles from the Apple Developer Portal:

[https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/)


## Using Appcircle Signing Identity module for Apple Certificates

### Creating an Apple Certificate

With Appcircle’s advanced Signing Identity module, you can easily generate certificates without logging into your Apple Developer account and securely store these certificates in  `.P12` format within the Appcircle.

- To do this, navigate to the Apple Certificates section within the Signing Identity module. Then, using the Add New button, you can create a certificate.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE5771-appCertMainPage.png' />

- In the opened window, continue by selecting the “Create an Apple Certificate” step.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE5771-addCertModal.png' />

- Appcircle **requires** an **App Store Connect API Key** associated with your account to create a certificate. If the API Key is **not** added to your Appcircle organization, you **cannot** proceed with the certificate creation process. For more information, please refer to the [**App Store Connect API Key**](/account/my-organization/security/credentials/adding-an-app-store-connect-api-key) documentation.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE5771-addCertAPIKeySelect.png' />

- After selecting the appropriate API Key, Appcircle requires a `CSR` (Certificate Signing Request) file to create an Apple certificate. With the options provided by Appcircle, you can either upload an existing CSR file from your local environment or select one created on Appcircle from the list. For more detailed information about the `CSR` creation process, please refer to the [**Generate Signing Request to Create Certificate**](/signing-identities/apple-certificates#creating-certificate-signing-request-file) section.

### Create Certificate with Uploading CSR

To create a certificate by uploading an existing `CSR` file, proceed by selecting the **Upload Certificate Signing Request** option. You must upload the `CSR` file you intend to use and specify the type of certificate you want to generate.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE5771-certFileUpload.png' />

After selecting the type of certificate you want to create, you will see a **password** field. This field is **optional** and is used to encrypt the `P12` file that will be exported after the certificate is created. You can manually enter a password in this field, or you can choose the **Automatically Generate Password** option to have the password generated **automatically**.

:::caution Generating Password

Adding a password during `P12` export is completely **optional**. If you do **not** specify a password, the `P12` file will be created without one. However, if you prefer for automatic password generation, be sure to record the password generated by Appcircle. Otherwise, you may **encounter issues** when using the provisioning file.

### Create Certificate with Existing CSR

If you want to create a certificate by selecting an existing `CSR` file in Appcircle, you can proceed by using the **Select Certificate Signing Request from List** option.

When this option is selected, all existing `CSR` files in Appcircle will be listed, prompting you to choose one. After selecting the relevant `CSR` file, the desired certificate type must be chosen. **Optionally**, a password can be specified, or the **Auto Generate Password** feature can be used to generate one automatically.

:::caution Generating Password

Adding a password during `P12` export is completely **optional**. If you do **not** specify a password, the `P12` file will be created without one. However, if you prefer for automatic password generation, be sure to record the password generated by Appcircle. Otherwise, you may **encounter** issues when using the provisioning file.

### Creating Certificate Signing Request File

The **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** file is required by **Apple** when creating a certificate. This file allows the user to generate a certificate, so it must be created in advance and provided as needed. Since this file can only be generated on a `macOS` operating system, it is unlikely to be created on other systems. Therefore, you can **easily** generate a `CSR` file using Appcircle’s **Generate Signing Request to Create Certificates** feature.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/BE5771-csrCreate.png' />

By correctly filling in the required parameters such as **name**, **email**, and **country** you can generate this file without needing a `macOS` operating system.

:::caution Generating CSR File

It is **important** that the information provided is **accurate**. Any errors in these details may **prevent** Apple from allowing the certificate generation process.

### Creating P12 File Without Mac

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/02-02-Add-iOS-Certificates.png' />

To generate your iOS certificates, simply fill in your details and Appcircle will provide a CSR (certificate signing request) which you can use on Apple Developer Portal to generate your signing certificate.

- Create a CSR File

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/02-07-Generate-iOS-Cert.png' />

- Download your CSR file
- Go to the Apple Developer Portal and select "Certificates, IDs & Profiles" from the left menu, then click on "Certificates."
  <Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/apple-addcertificate.png' />

- Select the type of certificate you want to create. If you want to distribute to TestFlight, Ad-hoc or AppStore, you should select Apple Distribution. If you're creating a certificate for local development environment, you should select Apple Development.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/apple-select-certificate-type.png' />

- Upload the CSR file you have created on Appcircle

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/apple-selectscr.png' />

- Download your generated CER file from the Apple Developer portal

- Upload the CER file to the signing identities module by clicking on the upload button next to the CSR file.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/ac-csr-list.png' />
<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/ac-createp12.png' />

- Your CSR will now be converted to a P12 file as an iOS signing certificate. (Please note that the P12 file comes with an empty password.)

### Uploading P12 Certificate

To upload your Apple Certificate, select "Upload Certificate Bundle (.p12)" button and upload your pre-obtained Apple Certificate file.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/02-02-Upload-iOS-Certificates.png' />

You can see a list of your created or uploaded certificates. Each certificate will display the certificate name, certificate type (development, ad-hoc, in-house, or app store distribution) along with expiration dates.

:::caution

If your password contains special characters such as `$` and `#`, your workflow may fail with `MAC verification failed during PKCS12 import` message. If you receive such an error, please export your P12 file by removing that symbol.
