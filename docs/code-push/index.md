The Appcircle CodePush feature is specifically designed for **React Native** projects. Other mobile technologies in the ecosystem **are not** supported. This feature **should only be used** in **React Native** projects.

## [Appcircle CodePush Profile](/code-push/code-push-profile/appcircle-code-push-profile)

To start using CodePush in your React Native project, you first need to create a CodePush profile in Appcircle.

## [Appcircle CodePush SDK](/code-push/code-push-sdk)

The Appcircle CodePush SDK is required to integrate CodePush functionality into your React Native application and to handle update processes on the client side.

## [Appcircle CodePush CLI](/code-push/code-push-cli)

The Appcircle CodePush CLI allows you to manage your CodePush deployments, upload new bundles, and interact with your CodePush profile from the command line.

## [CodePush via Build Module](/code-push/code-push-via-build-module)

You can also use the CodePush feature directly through the Appcircle Build Module to automate bundle uploads as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
