## Example: Migrating an App Center Organization to Appcircle

In this section, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the migration process from App Center to Appcircle. App Center and Appcircle manage organizations and distribution groups in slightly different manner. The following diagram illustrates a sample organization structure in both App Center and Appcircle.

**Organization Hierarchy for Migration:**

App Center organization hierarchy slated for migration is structured as follows:

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-194_appcenter_hierarchy.png' />

Migrated Appcircle organization is structured as follows:

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-194_appcircle_hierarchy.png' />

**Step-by-Step Migration Process:**

1. **Migrating Organizations:**

   - Migrate the organizations from App Center to Appcircle.
   - Appcircle uses a main-sub organization structure, meaning every organization you migrate will become part of a main organization.

2. **Migrating Apps:**

   - Create a Testing Distribution Profile in Appcircle for each app from App Center.
   - This process currently includes only the creation of the profile; migration of build configuration details is not supported yet.

3. **Migrating Distribution Groups:**
   - Migrate Distribution Groups from App Center to Appcircle.
   - App Center allows users to manage distribution groups at both the organization level and the app level.
   - In Appcircle, distribution groups are managed exclusively at the organization level.

### Migrate Organization

The appcenter-migration-tool migrates organizations to Appcircle as sub-organizations under a main organization. This means each migrated organization will be nested under a primary organization. During this migration, the tool will only create organizations that match those existing in App Center. If an organization with the same name already exists in Appcircle, the tool will provide an error.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-194_migrate_organization.png' />

```bash
appcenter-migration-tool organizations migrate-collaborators --organizationUsers=guven@appcircle.io --appcircleOrganization=Appcircle_Organization
```

### Migrate Organization Collaborators

The tool invites specified collaborators from App Center to the corresponding organization in Appcircle. As a major difference from App Center, Appcircle offers comprehensive [role management](/account/my-organization/profile-and-team/role-management) based on modules. During the invitation process, the roles of the collaborators from App Center are mapped to the Distribution Profile Roles and Testing Group Roles modules in Appcircle as follows:

| App Center Role | Appcircle Role | Module                                           |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Admin           | Manager        | Distribution Profile Roles & Testing Group Roles |
| Collaborator    | Operator       | Distribution Profile Roles & Testing Group Roles |
| Member          | Viewer         | Distribution Profile Roles & Testing Group Roles |

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-194_migrate_collaborators.png' />

```bash
appcenter-migration-tool organizations migrate --organizationNames=Appcircle_Organization
```

### Migrate App Center Apps to a Testing Distribution Profile at Appcircle

The tool creates a [Testing Distribution Profile](/testing-distribution/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile) in Appcircle using the specified App Center app name.

```bash
appcenter-migration-tool apps migrate-profile --profileNames=Appcircle
```

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-194_migrate_test_profile.png' />

:::caution
The tool creates only a new [Testing Distribution Profile](/testing-distribution/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile) and does not migrate any existing releases at this time.
:::

### Migrate Organization Distribution Groups

The tool migrates **distribution groups** of the organizations from App Center organizations to **testing groups** in Appcircle.

```bash
appcenter-migration-tool migrate-organization --organizationName=Appcircle_Organization --distributionGroupName=Internal --distGroupUsers=guven@appcircle.io
```

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/SP-194_migrate_app_profile.png' />

### Migrate App Distribution groups

The tool migrates **distribution groups** of the apps from App Center app to **testing groups** in Appcircle.

```bash
appcenter-migration-tool migrate-organization --organizationName=Appcircle_Organization --appName=Appcircle-iOS --distributionGroupNameForApp="Beta Testers" --distGroupUsersForApp=guven@appcircle.io

```

:::info
In App Center, distribution groups can be managed at both the organization level and the app level. In contrast, Appcircle consolidates all testing groups into a single management location.
