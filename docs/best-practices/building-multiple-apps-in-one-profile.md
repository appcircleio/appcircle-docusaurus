# Building Multiple Apps in One Profile

Depending on the structure of your project(s), at one point there might be a need to produce more than one application from a single codebase.

For this situation, there are two ways to accomplish this goal:

- Configure your relevant file to produce different outputs.
  - Android -> Build Variants with Product Flavors
  - For iOS -> Creating different Targets with Schemes
- Do the steps manually via custom scripts.

:::info

For this task, the developer should configure those from Android Studio or Xcode.

:::

> A different Application means a different packagename for Android and different bundleId for iOS.

### Using Android Product Flavors and Build Variant to Configure Multiple Apps

The Android Developers document has a detailed guide on how to configure build variants and product flavors:

https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants

The assets that you can directly change with the `productFlavor`

- Package Id -> packageName
- App Name
- App Icon

For more information, check the Android Developer Document on `productFlavor`

https://developer.android.com/reference/tools/gradle-api/4.2/com/android/build/api/dsl/ProductFlavor

#### How to Change Variant Programmatically on Appcircle

:::info

This method will not be required in common scenarios. Unless you have a special case, it is advised to stick with configuring `build.gradle` instead, as specified at the Android Developers document.

:::

For example, the script below will change the variant if the built branch is `release` .

:::tip

Put this script before the relevant **build **step. E.g. for Android, this script should be executed **before **`Android Build` step.

:::

Note: This script is in `Bash` language.

```bash
if [ $AC_GIT_BRANCH = 'release' ]; then
	echo "AC_VARIANTS=YOUR_FLAVOR" >> $AC_ENV_FILE_PATH
fi
```

### Using iOS Schemes to Configure Multiple Apps

Creating and controlling multiple Schemes on an Xcode project is fairly easy. Check the [Apple Help Documentation](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/dev0bee46f46) about how to create & manage schemes.

The assets that you can directly change with the Schemes

- Bundle ID
- Plist file
- App Icon

#### How to Change Target Programmatically on Appcircle

:::info

This method will not be required in common scenarios. Unless you have a special case, it is advised to configure multiple `plist` files and bundling them into a single scheme.

:::

For example, the script below will change the scheme if the built branch is `release` .

:::tip

Put this script before the relevant **build **step. E.g. for Android, this script should be executed **before **`Android Build` step.

:::

Note: This script is in `Bash` language.

```bash
if [ $AC_GIT_BRANCH = 'release' ]; then
	echo "AC_SCHEME=YOUR_FLAVOR" >> $AC_ENV_FILE_PATH
fi
```

### Testing & Downloading Multiple Apps Through Appcircle

As specified in the Appcircle docs, your multiple outputs will be located on the testing distribution and they will be available for download just like a single application.
