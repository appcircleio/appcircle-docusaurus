# Build Module Overview

The Build module in Appcircle streamlines your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows for mobile app development. It covers everything from code integration to managing your build profiles and post-build artifacts.

## [Build Profiles](/build/build-process-management)

Follow our start guide to build your iOS and Android apps in the cloud. This guide will walk you through creating a build profile, managing profiles, branches, configurations and triggers and more.

## [Environment Variables](/build/build-environment-variables)

Environment variables let you extend your build configuration. There are several read-only Appcircle variables and you can add your own variables to export during the build process and use in custom build scripts.

## [Connections](/build/manage-the-connections)

Set up integrations with version control systems to sync your repositories, allowing for automated builds and deployments.

## [Platform Build Guides](/build/platform-build-guides)

Find detailed instructions for building applications across various platforms including iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, and Ionic.

## [Build History](/build/build-history)

The Build History Report provides a comprehensive list of build sessions initiated within a selected time period. Users can filter their search based on date and organization for more precise tracking. Additionally, the report can be exported in CSV format for further analysis and record-keeping.
