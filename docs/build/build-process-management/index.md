# Build Profile Management

Master the management of your build profiles in Appcircle with the following features:

- [**Profile Configuration**](/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration): Set up and manage the configurations for your build profiles. This involves specifying the settings that control the build process for each app version.

- [**Branch Management**](/build/build-process-management/build-profile-branch-operations): Organize and handle different code branches within your repository. This section allows you to manage which branches are built and when.

- [**Manual and Automatic Builds**](/build/build-process-management/build-manually-or-with-triggers): Control how and when your builds are triggered. Opt for manual builds for greater control, or set up automatic builds to streamline your development pipeline whenever changes are pushed to your branches.
