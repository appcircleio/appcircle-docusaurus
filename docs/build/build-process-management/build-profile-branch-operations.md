# Build Profile Branch Management

When you connect to a repository, all branches of that repository will be displayed with the last 100 commits. Appcircle provides a number of features for easy management of branches.

### Finding a Specific Branch

To find a specific branch, just start typing in the name in the branch search bar and the branches that include the phrase will be filtered as you type.

### Pinning Branches to the Top for Faster Access

If you are using a branch frequently such as develop or master, you can pin it to the top. To pin a branch, click on pin icon next to the branch name.

The branch will be moved to the top with a pinned indicator. You can unpin the branch by pressing pin button again.
