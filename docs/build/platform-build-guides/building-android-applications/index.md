Before starting your first Android app build, please make sure you first create a build profile and connect your Git repository to your build profile. You can refer to the page below for this step:

<ContentRef url="/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile">Adding a Build Profile</ContentRef>

After connecting your repository, please add or create your Android Keystore. You can refer to the page below for this step:

<ContentRef url="/signing-identities/android-keystores">Android Keystores</ContentRef>

When you are done with the steps above, you can now start building your Android application.

### Build Configuration

First, we need to set up a build configuration. Select the configuration from the **Configuration** section. The first step will be to enter project details. You can enter details manually or click on the "Autofill" button to retrieve them from your project.

### Private Modules

If your project uses private modules, don't forget the add necessary SSH keys to your workflow steps. You can use `Activate SSH Private Key` step to add your private SSH keys.

<ContentRef url="/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-private-repository-via-ssh">Connecting to Private Repository via SSH</ContentRef>

You may also use `Authenticate with netrc` step to access your private modules.

### Sending the Build Status to the Repository Providers

At the bottom of the config tab, you will the **Set Commit Build Status **option.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/create-android-build-commit-status.png' />

When this option is enabled, the build status for that commit is shared with the repository provider.

### Build Triggers

Appcircle allows you to trigger builds manually or automatically using build triggers.

- On push: Whenever code is pushed to a configured branch, the build is triggered.
- On a tagged push: Whenever a tagged commit is pushed, the build is triggered for that commit. Commits without any tags are ignored.
- On push with selective tags: Whenever a commit includes one of the typed in tags, the build is triggered. You can specify tags with Unix shell-style wildcards to trigger builds.

You can visit the following page for details on build triggers:

<ContentRef url="/build/build-process-management/build-manually-or-with-triggers">
  Build Manually or Automatically with Webhooks and Triggers
</ContentRef>

### Signing

The next step on build configuration is Signing. Here, please select the Android Keystore you added at [Android Keystores](/signing-identities/android-keystores) page.

:::info

You can get both unsigned and signed build artifacts based on your configuration. Please note that unsigned builds will not be distributed by email.

:::

### Distribution

The next step on build configuration is Distribution. You can create a new distribution profile at this screen or select a previous profile you created earlier. You can also enable auto deployment features if you need to.

<ContentRef url="/distribute/create-or-select-a-distribution-profile">
  Create a Distribution Profile and Sharing with Testers
</ContentRef>

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/build-configuration-android-distribution.png' />

:::info

Any previous build can be deployed to the Testing Distribution without the need for rebuilding.

:::

### Environment Variables

The final step on build configuration is Environment Variables.

Appcircle Build module is simple and powerful. You can get your builds instantly just with a few clicks, advanced management of builds is also possible with the environment variables and workflows.

You can define variables and secrets to be incorporated during the build in the Environment Variables submodule so that you don't need to store certain keys and configurations within the repository.

Please see the following page for more information about environment variables:

<ContentRef url="/environment-variables">
  Why to Use Environment Variables and Secrets?
</ContentRef>

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/build-configuration-android-env-variables.png' />

Please click on the Save button and close this modal.

### Workflow Editor

You can use the workflow editor for in-depth configuration of all build steps. Please click on the workflow icon to open and use workflow editor.

:::info

Any custom operation during the build can be executed through the Custom Script step in the workflow.

:::

For details on using Appcircle's workflow editor, please see the related page below:

### Start Build

You are now ready to start your first build. Select the branch from the left side and click on the **Start Build** button.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/build-configuration-android-start-build.png' />

Select a configuration, workflow, commit id and click on **Start Build button**

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/build-configuration-android-build-modal.png' />

Appcircle will start building your application. Build log window will open and you can follow build process in realtime.

:::info

You can safely close the build log window, it won't affect the status of your build. You can come back and click on the build to track the status of your build.

**Distribute Your Build**

Your build will be distributed automatically if you had set up Auto Distribute earlier. You can also manually distribute builds at any time you like.

## FAQ

### chmod: cannot access './gradlew': No such file or directory

Every Android project has a `gradlew` file in the main repository directory. If the Android Build step can't find this file, you need to edit your workflow, find the Android Build Step and edit the `PROJECT PATH`. If your `gradlew` file is in the `android` folder, you need to write, `./android` in the edit box.

### How can I change the JDK version for autofill?

Appcircle currently has OpenJDK 11 (default), OpenJDK 8, OpenJDK 17 and OpenJDK 21. If you want to use a different Java version for your build pipeline, you can follow the steps [here](/workflows/common-workflow-steps/custom-script#how-to-change-java-version) and add a custom script to your workflow.

But unfortunately, you cannot use custom scripts for autofill operations, which make it easy to fill in configuration details while adding a new build profile.

For the autofill, we have two options to choose from.

#### 1. Change `JAVA_HOME` using `gradle.properties`

You can add the `org.gradle.java.home` entry to the `gradle.properties` file in your Android project.

For example, the below entry can be used to change the default Java version to 17 for the "Default M1 Pool".

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/Users/appcircle/.sdkman/candidates/java/17.0.9-zulu
```

You can get the JDK home paths for each build pool from [Android's build infrastructure](/infrastructure/android-build-infrastructure#java-version) Java section.

#### 2. Change `JAVA_HOME` using environment variables

You can use the [environment variables](/environment-variables/managing-variables) to enable the JDK version your project requires.

For example, you can take the following steps to change the default Java version to 17.

1. Create a variable group that has a variable with the properties below.
    1. The key should be `JAVA_HOME`.
    2. Value should be `/Users/appcircle/.sdkman/candidates/java/17.0.9-zulu`.
2. Go to the configuration section of the build profile that you want to autofill.
3. Go to the 'Env. Variables' tab in configuration.
    1. You should see the variable group that you created in the list.
4. Select the variable group that has `JAVA_HOME` and 'Save' settings.
5. Go back to the config tab and start autofilling there.

You can get the JDK home paths for each build pool from [Android's build infrastructure](/infrastructure/android-build-infrastructure#java-version) Java section.

### Gradle build after Bintray shutdown

```
  > Could not resolve com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java-util:3.09.0.
      > Could not get resource 'https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java-util/3.09.0/protobuf-java-util-3.09.0.pom'.
        > Could not GET 'https://jcenter.bintray.com/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java-util/3.09.0/protobuf-java-util-3.09.0.pom'. Received status code 502 from server: Bad Gateway
```

You may experience gradle build errors if your project uses Bintray resources. Since JFrog has shutdown Bintray on May 1, 2021. You should update your gradle file and move to Maven Central. Replace `jcenter()` with `mavenCentral()` in all your `build.gradle` files. Please be aware that some of your dependencies may not exist on Maven.

### Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly

If you receive a Gradle error similar to the following, it can happen due to 2 reasons

```
org.gradle.launcher.daemon.client.DaemonDisappearedException: Gradle build daemon disappeared unexpectedly (it may have been killed or may have crashed)
    at org.gradle.launcher.daemon.client.DaemonClient.handleDaemonDisappearance(DaemonClient.java:222)
    at org.gradle.launcher.daemon.client.DaemonClient.monitorBuild(DaemonClient.java:198)
    at org.gradle.launcher.daemon.client.DaemonClient.executeBuild(DaemonClient.java:162)
    at org.gradle.launcher.daemon.client.DaemonClient.execute(DaemonClient.java:125)
```

```
Unexpected error while writing dex file using d8: Java heap space
java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
```

- Problem with UTF-8 characters in your project or environment variable. Please edit your **gradle.properties** file and add `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` argument to `org.gradle.jvmargs` section.
- You have edited **gradle.properties** and put some arguments to the `org.gradle.jvmargs` section. When you modify default JVM arguments, it resets the default `MaxMetaspaceSize` property. You should always add `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m` to this section to prevent unlimited memory allocation.

If you're using DexGuard, you may need to above modifications to your DexGuard configuration as well.

### I received a google-services.json Error but I don't want to push this file to the repository

Secret files such as the google-services.json can be added as a [secret environment variable](/environment-variables/managing-variables#adding-files-as-environment-variables) and then [selected in the build configuration](/build/build-process-management/build-profile-configuration#environment-variables-configuration).

Then, you can add a custom script step before the Android build step and move the file to the expected path during the build with a code like the following (where the secret environment variable is named as `GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON`) :

```bash
cd $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR/
mv $GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON $AC_REPOSITORY_DIR/app
```
### Android Keystore Errors

#### Missing keystore path error on Android builds

You may want to build unsigned Android applications. The most common mistake done with this is Appcircle users usually forget to disable the Sign Application step in the workflow.;

If you do not select a keystore in the build configuration, you need to disable the Sign Application step or your build will fail.

#### Keystore was tampered with or password was incorrect

You may get this error message when the provided password doesn't match the keystore file.

If you are using a debug keystore, simply re-generate it. Otherwise, please make sure you have the correct keystore/password combination.
