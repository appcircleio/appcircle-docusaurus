# Platform-Specific Guidance: iOS

The iOS section provides comprehensive guides on two critical processes for iOS apps â€” distribution to Apple devices and resigning iOS binaries.

- **Distributing to Apple Devices**: This guide covers the necessary steps and considerations for distributing iOS apps, whether for testing or release. It's tailored to ensure that your apps reach your intended audience through the proper channels, such as the App Store or Ad-Hoc distribution.

- **Resigning iOS Binaries**: Resigning is a vital process when transferring apps between accounts or modifying application entitlements. This guide details the process of resigning your binaries, ensuring they are correctly signed with the appropriate certificates and profiles before distribution.
