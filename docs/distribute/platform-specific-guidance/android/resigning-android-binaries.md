# Resigning

Resigning is the process of modifying an existing binary with a new signing certificate or keystore, which is required when an application needs to be published under a different developer account or when updating an existing application. It involves removing the original signature and replacing it with a new one.

## Resigning Android Binaries

To sign an Android binary, you need a valid keystore file. Appcircle supports both APK and AAB files. The process of signing an Android binary involves selecting the correct keystore file. Once these details are entered, Appcircle will generate a new signed binary with the updated information.

1. Select the binary.

You can either select the files from the list or upload APK, and AAB files by clicking the **Upload New Version** button at the bottom.
