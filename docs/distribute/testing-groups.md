# Testing Groups

The testing group feature helps you manage and organize your testers. You can distribute different versions of applications to specific groups based on your testing needs, such as OS versions, features, devices, and more.

With the testing groups feature, you can define various groups for different audiences. For instance, in an enterprise, you may want to create groups such as testing team, marketing, management, and any other functional group. For an app developer, testing groups can be created for customers and apps. This allows streamlined management of binary sharing flows. You can send apps manually to these groups or associate different distribution profiles with different groups for automatic distribution.

You can list, add, edit and manage your groups and testers from this module.

After creating a new testing group, you can add tester email addresses to the group. Use the input box at the top of the page to enter the email address and press enter.

You will now see a list of your testers. You can also select and delete testers as needed.

### Managing Unsubscribed Users

When re-sharing the app with users who have previously unsubscribed, you can seamlessly re-engage them.

This action automatically removes them from the unsubscribed list, allowing them to receive emails once again.

A prominent orange warning message confirms the successful re-subscription process, ensuring a seamless experience.

If a user who has previously unsubscribed is included in a test group, they will not be re-subscribed when sharing with the test group.
