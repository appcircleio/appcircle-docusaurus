# Testing Management

Efficiently manage your app testing with the following features:

- **Testing Groups**: Organize your testers into groups to streamline the distribution process. Create different groups for various testing stages or criteria, like internal testing, beta users, or QA teams.

- **Using the Testing Portal**: Utilize the testing portal to distribute your apps to testers. It allows testers to download and install app versions directly, facilitating an efficient feedback loop. Provide clear instructions and gather valuable insights to improve app quality before release.
