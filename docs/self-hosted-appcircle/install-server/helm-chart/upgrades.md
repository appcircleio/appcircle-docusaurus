## Updating to a Specific Version

You can specify a **specific version** of the Appcircle Helm chart by adding the `--version` flag to the Helm upgrade command.

For instance, to upgrade the **Appcircle Helm chart** to a **specific version** and view the Appcircle server Helm chart versions that are available:

1. Check the list of available versions.

```bash
helm search repo appcircle
```

The output should look like the following:

```bash
NAME               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION	DESCRIPTION
appcircle/appcircle	0.1.0        	3.23.2     	A Helm chart for Kubernetes
appcircle/appcircle	0.2.0        	3.25.0     	A Helm chart for Kubernetes
```

2. Update the Appcircle Helm chart to a specific version.

```bash
helm upgrade appcircle-server appcircle/appcircle \
  --version 0.2.0 \
  --timeout 1200s \
  -n appcircle \
  -f values.yaml
```

By following these steps, you can upgrade your Appcircle server to a specific version of the Helm chart.

### Why is my Helm chart not updating to the latest version?

If your Helm chart is not updating to the latest version, it could be due to several reasons such as an outdated repository, local cache issues, or network problems. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Update the Helm Repository:** Make sure your Helm repository is up to date by running the following command:

   ```sh
   helm repo update
   ```

2. **Clear the Local Cache:** Sometimes, clearing the local cache can help in fetching the latest charts.

- For Linux, delete `$HOME/.cache/helm` directory.
  ```sh
  rm -rf "$HOME/.cache/helm"
  ```
- For MacOS, delete `$HOME/Library/Caches/helm` directory.
  ```sh
  rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Caches/helm"
  ```
- For Windows, delete `%TEMP%\helm` folder.

3. **Re-add the Repository:** If the update doesn't resolve the issue, try removing and re-adding the repository:

   ```sh
   helm repo remove appcircle
   helm repo add appcircle https://helm-package.appcircle.io
   helm repo update
   ```

4. **Verify the Index:** After updating, you can check the repository index to ensure that the latest version is available.

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://helm-package.appcircle.io/index.yaml | grep -A 5 'appcircle'
   ```

5. **Check for Errors:** Ensure there are no issues with your internet connection or any firewall rules that might be blocking the update.
