## Overview

With default installation, self-hosted Appcircle comes with the connection options below:

- Bitbucket
- Azure
- GitLab
- Connect via SSH
- Connect via URL

But you're not limited with these options. You can configure the git providers and use them within your self-hosted Appcircle server.

### Enable/Disable Git Providers

If you want to enable or disable any of these providers, you can do so by updating your `values.yaml` file.

In the example below, there are enabled git providers list with comma separated:

```yaml
web:
  web-app:
    selfHostedGitProviders:
      - "bitbucketServer"
      - "azureDevopsServer"
      - "gitlabSelfHosted"
      - "ssh"
      - "publicRepository"
```

You can delete the providers you do not need by removing them from `selfHostedGitProviders` list above.
