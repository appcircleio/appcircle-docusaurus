## Secrets for Sensitive Values

To manage sensitive information such as the Appcircle initial user password, SSL certificates, and other secrets, it is recommended to use Kubernetes secrets. This ensures that sensitive data is stored securely and can be accessed by applications running within the cluster in a controlled manner. Some settings like SMTP can be configured either through Kubernetes secrets during initial deployment or directly from the Appcircle Dashboard after installation.

:::caution
The configurations for secret values should be **done before the first deployment** and **cannot be changed later**. To modify these settings, you should **[uninstall Appcircle](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/helm-chart/uninstallation)** and redeploy it.
:::

:::info
The commands below assume you have already created a namespace for Appcircle. If you havenâ€™t yet, you can create the Appcircle namespace using the following commands:

```bash
# Create the namespace
kubectl create namespace appcircle
```

Make sure to replace `appcircle` with your preferred namespace name if necessary.
:::

You can follow the steps below to create a secret for each sensitive value.

:::tip
If the `HISTCONTROL` environment variable is set to `ignoreboth`, commands with a leading space character will not be stored in the shell history. This allows you to create secrets safely without storing sensitive information in the shell history.
:::

#### Appcircle initial user password

- Create a secret with the name `${releaseName}-auth-keycloak-passwords` containing the `initialPassword` and `adminPassword` keys.

:::info
In the example, **`appcircle-server`** is used as the **release name**. Make sure to replace it with your actual release name if it's different.
:::

```bash
kubectl create secret generic appcircle-server-auth-keycloak-passwords \
  --from-literal=initialPassword=Test1234 \
  --from-literal=adminPassword=KeycloakAdminPassword1234 \
  -n appcircle
```

- Remove the `.auth.auth-keycloak.initialPassword` and `.auth.auth-keycloak.adminPassword` keys from the `values.yaml` file if they exist.

#### SMTP password

:::caution
Starting from the server version `3.28.2`, SMTP settings can be configured and updated directly from the Appcircle Dashboard. This is the recommended approach for managing SMTP settings as it allows you to update the configuration at any time without requiring server reset.

See [Email Integration docs](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/integration#configure-via-dashboard-recommended) for more details.
:::

If you prefer to configure SMTP via Kubernetes secrets during initial deployment:

- Create a secret with the name `${releaseName}-smtp` containing the `password` key.

:::info
In the example, **`appcircle-server`** is used as the **release name**. Make sure to replace it with your actual release name if it's different.
:::

```bash
kubectl create secret generic appcircle-server-smtp \
  --from-literal=password="superSecretSMTPPassword" \
  -n appcircle
```

- Remove the `.global.mail.smtp.password` key from the `values.yaml` file if it exists.

:::tip
Even if you initially configure SMTP using Kubernetes secrets, you can still use the Appcircle Dashboard for subsequent updates.
:::

#### SSL certificate

- Create a secret with the name `appcircle-tls-wildcard` containing the `tls.crt`, `tls.key` and `ca.crt` keys.

:::caution
The name **`appcircle-tls-wildcard`** is **reserved** and **cannot be changed**.
:::

```bash
kubectl create secret generic appcircle-tls-wildcard \
  --from-file=tls.crt='fullchain.crt' \
  --from-file=tls.key='private.key' \
  --from-file=ca.crt='root-ca.crt' \
  --type=kubernetes.io/tls \
  -n appcircle
```

- Remove the `.global.tlsWildcard` key from the `values.yaml` file if it exists.
