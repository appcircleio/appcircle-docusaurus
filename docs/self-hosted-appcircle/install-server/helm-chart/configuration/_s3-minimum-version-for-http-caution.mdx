:::caution
In order to use HTTP (`useHttp: "true"`) for the S3 endpoint, the Appcircle server version should be at least **`3.28.2`** or later.

Please [check](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/helm-chart/upgrades#updating-to-the-latest-version) the Appcircle server version and **upgrade** the Helm chart **if necessary**. See the Helm chart [version history](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/helm-chart/upgrades#version-history) for releases to choose an appropriate one.
