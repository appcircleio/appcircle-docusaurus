## Overview

In this section, you will learn how to configure Helm values for Kubernetes installations. These configurations will guide you through setting up various parameters and options to ensure a successful deployment of the Appcircle server. 

By customizing the `values.yaml` file, you can tailor the installation to meet your specific requirements, including external database connections, storage options, and other critical settings. This documentation provides detailed instructions and examples to help you optimize your Kubernetes deployment using Helm.

Some example commands in this documentation are written for Linux and macOS terminals. You can use the appropriate alternatives for other operating systems.

:::info
When using the example `values.yaml` files provided in this document, please ensure that you check your own `values.yaml` keys. Do not add keys multiple times; simply update the existing keys with the appropriate values.

## Secrets for Sensitive Values

To manage sensitive information such as the Appcircle initial user password, SMTP password, SSL certificates, and other secrets, it is recommended to use Kubernetes secrets. This ensures that sensitive data is stored securely and can be accessed by applications running within the cluster in a controlled manner.

:::caution
The configurations for production readiness should be **done before the first deployment** and **cannot be changed later**. To modify these settings, you should **[uninstall Appcircle](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/helm-chart/uninstallation.md)** and redeploy it.
:::

:::info
The commands below assume you have already created a namespace for Appcircle. If you havenâ€™t yet, you can create and switch to the Appcircle namespace using the following commands:

```bash
# Create the namespace
kubectl create namespace appcircle

# Switch to the newly created namespace
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=appcircle
```

Make sure to replace `appcircle` with your preferred namespace name if necessary.
:::

You can follow the steps below to create a secret for each sensitive value.

:::tip
If the `HISTCONTROL` environment variable is set to `ignoreboth`, commands with a leading space character will not be stored in the shell history. This allows you to create secrets safely without storing sensitive information in the shell history.
:::

#### Appcircle initial user password

- Create a secret with the name `${releaseName}-auth-keycloak-passwords` containing the `initialPassword` and `adminPassword` keys.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic appcircle-server-auth-keycloak-passwords \
  --from-literal=initialPassword=Test1234 \
  --from-literal=adminPassword=KeycloakAdminPassword1234
```

- Remove the `.auth.auth-keycloak.initialPassword` and `.auth.auth-keycloak.adminPassword` keys from the `values.yaml` file if they exist.

#### SMTP password

- Create a secret with the name `${releaseName}-smtp` containing the `password` key.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic appcircle-server-smtp \
  --from-literal=password="superSecretSMTPPassword"
```

- Remove the `.global.mail.smtp.password` key from the `values.yaml` file if it exists.

#### SSL certificate

- Create a secret with the name `appcircle-tls-wildcard` containing the `tls.crt`, `tls.key` and `ca.crt` keys.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic appcircle-tls-wildcard \
  --from-file=tls.crt='fullchain.crt' \
  --from-file=tls.key='private.key' \
  --from-file=ca.crt='root.crt' \
  --type=kubernetes.io/tls
```

- Remove the `.global.tlsWildcard` key from the `values.yaml` file if it exists.
