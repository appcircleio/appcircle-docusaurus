## Overview

An Appcircle server Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a pre-configured template used to create virtual servers, known as instances, in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment.

Think of it as a snapshot of a server that includes the operating system, necessary tools, applications, and any additional services needed to run the Appcircle server.

## Pre-requirements

### Appcircle Requirements

- You should contact us to get the license file for accessing to the Appcircle Google cloud resources such as container images.

- If you are a licensed user, you should contact us to the licensed Appcircle server package with your actual license.

- If you are a PoC user, you can go on with the package located in the AMI.

### Technical Requirements

Before using the Appcircle server AMI, there is a couple of things that you need to handle.

- Understanding of AWS Services

A basic understanding of Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, particularly EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), is beneficial.

Users should be familiar with instance creation, networking, security groups, and storage configurations.

- AWS Account

You must have an active AWS account with appropriate permissions to launch EC2 instances and work with other related services.

- Networking and Security Configuration

You might need to configure networking aspects such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, route tables, and security groups to properly integrate the instance within their network environment and manage access controls.

- Linux System Configuration

Basic familiarity with Linux system configurations and commands is essential since this document will use some linux commands.
