When you complete installation successfully by following the above steps, you're ready for your first build. :tada:

But in order to run build pipelines, you need to install and connect self-hosted runners. We have a dedicated section for the installation and configuration of self-hosted runners. Follow and apply related the guidelines [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/self-hosted-runner/installation).

:::tip
Appcircle also supports the installation and execution of the runners on AWS.

You can see the details about how to configure a runner on AWS **[here](/self-hosted-appcircle/self-hosted-runner/cloud-providers/aws)**.
:::

The self-hosted runner section in the documents has all the details about runners and their configuration.

:::caution

By default, self-hosted runner package has pre-configured `ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL` for Appcircle-hosted cloud.

- `https://api.appcircle.io/build/v1`

:point_up: You need to change its value with your self-hosted Appcircle server's API URL.

Assuming our sample scenario explained in [configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#3-configure), its value should be

- `http://api.appcircle.spacetech.com/build/v1`

for our sample scenario.

:reminder_ribbon: After [download](/self-hosted-appcircle/self-hosted-runner/installation#1-download), open `appsettings.json` with a text editor and change `ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL` value according to your configuration.

Please note that you should do this before [registering](/self-hosted-appcircle/self-hosted-runner/installation#2-register).

:::

Considering system performance, it will be good to install self-hosted runners on other machines. A self-hosted Appcircle server should run on a dedicated machine itself.

You can install any number of runners according to your needs and connect them to a self-hosted Appcircle server.
