After you successfully connect to the Appcircle instance, the first thing you should do is start a system update. Although the Appcircle AMI is up-to-date, it is recommended that you perform security updates again.

```bash
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade
```

The Appcircle server directory is located in the `$HOME` directory as the `appcircle-server` folder.

```bash
ls -l "$HOME"
```

Change the current working directory to that folder.

```bash
cd "$HOME/appcircle-server"
```

**If you are a licensed user**, please [contact us](https://appcircle.io/support/) to get the licensed Appcircle zip package. You should [upgrade](/self-hosted-appcircle/update) the pre-installed package in the instance.

Also, put the `cred.json` file you received from us into the `appcircle-server` folder.

Please [contact us](https://appcircle.io/support/) to purchase an enterprise license if you don't have one.

Now you're ready to configure the Appcircle server according to your needs. Follow the detailed [configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#3-configure) steps.

You should also configure the [DNS](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#4-dns-settings) settings for your Appcircle server instance. Create `A` and `CNAME` records for your instance.

After the configuration is done, [initialize the project](/docs/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker.md#5-initialize-vault), [run the server](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#6-run-server), and go to the Appcircle server dashboard using the main [domain](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#4-dns-settings) you defined.
