# Integrations and Access

A crucial part of setting up your self-hosted Appcircle environment involves configuring various integrations and access controls. This section provides detailed guides for connecting your Appcircle instance with external services and setting up the necessary access configurations.

### [Git Providers](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/git-providers)

Connect with popular Git providers like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc., to seamlessly integrate your code repositories with your CI/CD pipeline.

### [Integrations](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/integration)

Manage additional service integrations to enhance the functionality of your self-hosted instance with tools for monitoring, logging, analytics, and more.

### [SSL Configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/ssl-configuration)

Ensure secure communications by configuring SSL, which is vital for protecting your data and maintaining trust with users interacting with your server.

### [Network Access](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/network-access)

Set up network access rules to define how your server communicates with other networks and services, including firewall settings and access permissions.

### [Login Configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/login-configuration)

Customize login settings for your server to determine how users will authenticate and gain access to the Appcircle platform.

### [Proxy Configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/proxy-configuration)

Configure proxy settings for your server to route traffic through a proxy server, which can be crucial for complying with network policies or enhancing security.

### [LDAP Settings](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/ldap-settings)

Integrate with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for centralized user management, allowing users to sign in with their enterprise credentials.
