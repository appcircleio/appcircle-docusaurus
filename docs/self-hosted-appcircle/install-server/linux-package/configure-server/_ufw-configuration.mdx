If you are using `UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)`, you need to open the 80 and 443 ports for the Appcircle server.

Check if the `ufw` is active.

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

If you see `Status: active` as the output, you should allow TCP 80 and TCP 443 ports for Appcircle server to accept connections.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80 && \
sudo ufw allow 443
```

To check if the ports are open, you can run the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw status verbose
```
