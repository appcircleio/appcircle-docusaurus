To ensure uninterrupted operation of the Appcircle server's background processes, you must enable the **linger** option on the host system.

Enabling this option allows the podman containers to persist even after user logouts, ensuring continuous functionality.

Check if the **linger** option is enabled for the current user with the below command.

```bash
loginctl show-user "$USER" --property=Linger
```

If you see `Linger=yes`, it means that the option is enabled and you do not need extra configuration.

If the output is `Linger=no`, this means that the option is disabled and you cannot run the Appcircle server in the background.

:::caution
If the **linger** option is set to `no`, you must enable it to run the Appcircle server in the background.

To enable the lingerÂ option, you can use the command below:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger
```
