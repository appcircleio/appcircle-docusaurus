##### :new: Redis Subdomain 

Upgrading from older versions to `3.18.0` or later requires `redis` subdomain that should be registered before upgrading. For more details, you can checkout the [DNS Configuration](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/installation/docker#4-dns-settings) document section.

If you are not using the Appcircle server with HTTPS, you must also allow the Appcircle runners to connect to the Appcircle server with the TCP `6379` port. For more details, you can checkout the [Network Access](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/configure-server/integrations-and-access/network-access#appcircle-server) requirements between the Appcircle runners and the Appcircle server.

Also, you may consider updating the SSL certificate of the Appcircle server if it doesn't cover the `redis` subdomain.
