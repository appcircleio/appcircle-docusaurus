When users enter `store.spacetech.com` into their browser, the browser initially sends the request to `HTTP` port `80`. Without proper redirection from port `80` to port `443` (`HTTPS`), users will encounter a connection error.

Allowing port `80` for redirection ensures that users are seamlessly directed to the secure `HTTPS` deployment of the Appcircle services.
