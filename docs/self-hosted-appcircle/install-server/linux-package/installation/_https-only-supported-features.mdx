Beginning from version **`3.29.3`** some of the Appcircle server features are not supported for `http` configuration.

Below is the list of features that can only be used when `https` is enabled:
- [Account Management](/account/my-account/account-management)
- SAML-based SSO [Authentications](/account/my-organization/security/authentications)

For full functionality and better security, it's recommended to install and operate all Appcircle services with `https` configuration, especially for production environments.
