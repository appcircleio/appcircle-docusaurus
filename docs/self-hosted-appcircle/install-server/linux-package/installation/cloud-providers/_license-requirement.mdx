If you don't apply a license, you can go on with the package located in the server and use the Appcircle server as a "Starter Plan" user. But it's recommended to purchase a license from Appcircle that will increment the license limits and enable you to access the Appcircle resources for future upgrades.

If you are a licensed user, you should [contact us](https://appcircle.io/support/) about the licensed Appcircle server package that includes your actual license.
