After you successfully connect to the Appcircle instance, the first thing you should do is start a system update. Although the Appcircle server is up-to-date, it is recommended that you perform security updates again.

```bash
sudo apt update && \
sudo apt upgrade
```

The Appcircle server directory is located in the `$HOME` directory as the `appcircle-server` folder.

```bash
ls -l "$HOME"
```

Change the current working directory to that folder.

```bash
cd "$HOME/appcircle-server"
```
