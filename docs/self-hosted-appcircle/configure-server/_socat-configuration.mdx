When using Podman rootless to install the Appcircle server, please note that privileged ports (ports below 1024) cannot be utilized in rootless mode. By default, the Appcircle server listens on ports 8080 and 8443.

If you want to use ports 80 and 443 without running Podman as root, you need to take some extra steps.

Best option is to use a port forwarding tool like socat. This way you can forward traffic from port 80 to 8080 and port 443 to 8443. You should install the socat from official repositories and create two systemd service so port forwarding keeps even after server reboot. This can be done by running the following steps:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y socat
```

Save the file below as `port-redirect-80.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/port-redirect-80.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Port Redirect Service - Port 80
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat TCP-LISTEN:80,fork,reuseaddr TCP:127.0.0.1:8080

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save the file below as `port-redirect-443.service` in `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.

```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/port-redirect-443.service
```

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Port Redirect Service - Port 443
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/socat TCP-LISTEN:443,fork,reuseaddr TCP:127.0.0.1:8443

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Then, execute the below commands to activate port redirections.

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
sudo systemctl enable --now port-redirect-80.service && \
sudo systemctl enable --now port-redirect-443.service
```
