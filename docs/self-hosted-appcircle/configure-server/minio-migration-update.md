## Overview

By default, the Appcircle server utilizes MinIO in a single node single drive (`snsd`) configuration, employing version v3.14.0. Previous versions of the Appcircle server utilized MinIO in a multi-node single drive (`mnsd`) setup, which resulted in increased disk usage. However, with the transition to Appcircle server v3.14.0 and the adoption of `snsd` MinIO, disk consumption is anticipated to decrease by approximately 20%.

This documentation provides comprehensive instructions on migrating from the `mnsd` MinIO configuration to the `snsd` MinIO setup within the new Appcircle server version.

:::caution
Please note that this process will cause downtime since it requires a restart of the Appcircle server.
:::

## Prerequisites for Migrating

For a successful migration from mnsd MinIO to snsd MinIO, it's essential to ensure adequate free disk space on the Appcircle server.

To determine the required disk space, follow the steps below:

- SSH into the Appcircle server.

- Check the total disk space.

```bash
df -h
```

```bash
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs        5.7G     0  5.7G   0% /dev
tmpfs           5.8G     0  5.8G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           5.8G   28M  5.8G   1% /run
tmpfs           5.8G     0  5.8G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/vda3        80G   22G   59G  27% /
/dev/vda2       100M  5.8M   95M   6% /boot/efi
tmpfs           1.2G     0  1.2G   0% /run/user/1000
```

## Updating the Appcircle Server

### Download Latest

Download the latest self-hosted Appcircle package.

```bash
curl -O -L https://cdn.appcircle.io/self-hosted/appcircle/appcircle-server-linux-x64-3.10.1.zip
```

Extract self-hosted Appcircle package into folder.

```bash
unzip -o -u appcircle-server-linux-x64-3.10.1.zip -d appcircle-server
```

Change directory into extracted `appcircle-server` folder for following steps.

```bash
cd appcircle-server
```

<SpacetechExampleInfo />

Shutdown the Appcircle server.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" down
```

### Update Packages

Although it's rare, update may have new packages or package updates. Those are the tools that self-hosted Appcircle depends on. So they should be kept up-to-date same as Appcircle server.

:::caution

You need to have root access on your system for this step. Being able to run `sudo` is sufficient for the following step. (sudoer)

:::

In order to update packages, execute the script using the `-i` argument as shown below.

```bash
sudo ./ac-self-hosted.sh -i
```

### Update Server

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="snsd" label="Migrate to SNSD MinIO (Recommended)" default>

Migrating to `snsd` MinIO does not necessitate any additional configuration adjustments in the global.yaml file of the project.

Execute below command to apply new configurations.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" export
```

### MinIO Migrate

Migration from `mnsd` to `snsd` can be accomplished seamlessly with a single command.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" minio-migrate "mnsd" "snsd"
```

Upon successful completion of the migration process, you should see an output like in the example:

```text
...
Migration logs are being saved into the minio-migration-20240329082833 file.
Migration command completed successfully.
```

Detailed migration logs are being saved into a file named minio-migration-datetime.
You can access and review the comprehensive migration logs from this file for further insights into the migration process.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="mnsd" label="Stay With MNSD MinIO">

To remain with the `mnsd` MinIO configuration and not proceed with migration, it's necessary to specify the MinIO type in the `global.yaml` file of the project.

Edit the `global.yaml` file.

```bash
vi ./projects/spacetech/global.yaml
```

Add the `minio` and `type` keys. Specify the `mnsd` as the type.

```yaml
minio:
  type: mnsd
```

Then execute below command to apply new configurations.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" export
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Update Images

In order to get container image updates for Appcircle server services, we need to pull them from remote artifact repository.

Upgrade the container images.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" upgrade
```

Then start with below command.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" up
```

When complete, check service statuses.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" check
```

You may also print the image hashes and script's version by using the below command.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" version
```

## Notes

###Â If the Disk is Full-Filled While Migration

@TODO

### Testing the Migration

To test if the migration is successful and the data is consisted, you can check the steps below.

- Open an "Build Profile" and check the build logs.

- Open an "Publish Profile" and check the publish logs.

- Open an "Testing Distribution Profile" and check the app icons.

- Open the "Enterprise App Store" and check the app icons.

### If you face an migration error.

This migration operation doesn't delete the old minio volumes. So if you face any error while migrating or after migrated to the `SNSD` minio type, you can head back to the old `MNSD` minio type.

To go back to `MNSD` minio type, edit the `global.yaml` file of your project and change the minio type.

Stop the Appcircle server.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" down
```

```yaml
minio:
  type: mnsd
```

Then apply the new configurations.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" export
```

Start the Appcircle server.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" start
```

### Deleting the Old Volumes

If there is no errors while [Testing the Migration](#testing-the-migration), you can delete the old minio volumes to save disk space.

- To delete the old volumes, you can simple run the command below.

:::info
Please change the `spacetech` with your actual project name and change the `docker` to `podman` if you are using podman.
:::

```bash
docker volume rm spacetech_minio_data1 spacetech_minio_data2 spacetech_minio_data3 spacetech_minio_data4
```
