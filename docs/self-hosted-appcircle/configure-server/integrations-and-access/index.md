# Integrations and Access

A crucial part of setting up your self-hosted Appcircle environment involves configuring various integrations and access controls. This section provides detailed guides for connecting your Appcircle instance with external services and setting up the necessary access configurations.

### Git Providers

Connect with popular Git providers like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc., to seamlessly integrate your code repositories with your CI/CD pipeline.

### Integrations

Manage additional service integrations to enhance the functionality of your self-hosted instance with tools for monitoring, logging, analytics, and more.

### SSL Configuration

Ensure secure communications by configuring SSL, which is vital for protecting your data and maintaining trust with users interacting with your server.

### Network Access

Set up network access rules to define how your server communicates with other networks and services, including firewall settings and access permissions.

### Login Configuration

Customize login settings for your server to determine how users will authenticate and gain access to the Appcircle platform.

### Proxy Configuration

Configure proxy settings for your server to route traffic through a proxy server, which can be crucial for complying with network policies or enhancing security.

### LDAP Settings

Integrate with LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) for centralized user management, allowing users to sign in with their enterprise credentials.
