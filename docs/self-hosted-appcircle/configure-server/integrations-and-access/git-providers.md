With default installation, self-hosted Appcircle comes with the connection options below:

- Bitbucket
- Azure
- GitLab
- Connect via SSH
- Connect via URL

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2031-git-providers-v2.png' />

But you're not limited with these options. You can configure the git providers and use them within your self-hosted Appcircle server, same as in cloud.

Following sections will give you more details about removing or adding other git providers.

:::info

We're assuming that previously you reviewed or followed [install self-hosted appcircle](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#3-configure) section in docs, understood configuration made there and scenarios told there.

:::

:::caution

Current working directory is assumed `appcircle-server` for following steps. See [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#1-download) for installation details.

:::

:::caution

`global.yaml` configuration file is located under **project** folder.

- `projects/${YOUR_PROJECT}`

You can see an example project configuration from [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#3-configure).

:::

## Connect to Bitbucket Server

To disable the "Bitbucket" option, add the below configuration to `global.yaml`.

```yaml
build:
  oauths:
    bitbucketServer:
      enabled: false
```

If you want to re-enable "Bitbucket" again, you can set the `enabled` to `true`.

For more details about "Bitbucket" usage, see related docs in the [Connecting to Bitbucket](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-bitbucket) page.

## Connect to Azure Devops Server

To disable the "Azure" option, add the below configuration to `global.yaml`.

```yaml
build:
  oauths:
    azureDevopsServer:
      enabled: false
```

If you want to re-enable "Azure" again, you can set the `enabled` to `true`.

For more details about "Azure" usage, see related docs in the [Connecting to Azure DevOps](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-azure) page.

## Connect to Self-Managed GitLab

To disable the "GitLab" option, add the below configuration to `global.yaml`.

```yaml
build:
  oauths:
    gitlabSelfHosted:
      enabled: false
```

If you want to re-enable "GitLab" again, you can set the `enabled` to `true`.

For more details about "GitLab" usage, see related docs in the [Connecting to GitLab](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-gitlab) page.

## Connect via SSH

To disable the "Connect via SSH" option, add the below configuration to `global.yaml`.

```yaml
build:
  oauths:
    ssh:
      enabled: false
```

If you want to re-enable "Connect via SSH" again, you can set the `enabled` to `true`.

For more details about "Connect via SSH" usage, see related docs in the [Connect via SSH](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-private-repository-via-ssh) page.

To apply the changes, please follow [Applying Git Provider Changes](#applying-git-provider-changes)

## Connect via URL

To disable the "Connect via URL" option, add the below configuration to `global.yaml`.

```yaml
build:
  oauths:
    publicRepository:
      enabled: false
```

If you want to re-enable "Connect via URL" again, you can set the `enabled` to `true`.

For more details about "Connect via URL" usage, see related docs in the [Connect via URL](/build/manage-the-connections/adding-a-build-profile/connecting-to-public-repository) page.

## Applying Git Provider Changes

You can add or remove git providers at [installation](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker) steps or later when you need. Following sections will explain how to apply changes especially after installation.

Let's assume we want to disable both "Connect via SSH" and "Connect via URL" options. Then we need to add below section to our `global.yaml`.

```yaml
build:
  oauths:
    ssh:
      enabled: false
    publicRepository:
      enabled: false
```

:::caution

You should have only one `build.oauths` section in your `global.yaml` file.

Keep in mind that if you have multiple `build.oauths` sections in `global.yaml`, then the last one will be used in the Appcircle server runtime.

Be careful while configuring different connection options at the same time. Union them under one `build.oauths` section in the `global.yaml`.

:::

If we **do** this at installation time then there is no extra step to take. These options will be disabled on first boot without any extra effort.

If we **don't do** the configuration at installation, then after editing `global.yaml`, we need to apply below steps to activate changes.

:::info

We're assuming that previously you reviewed or followed [install self-hosted appcircle](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#3-configure) section in docs and applied example scenario.

Following steps are using example project as project naming, which was told there.

:::

1. Shutdown Appcircle server.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" down
```

2. Apply configuration changes.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" export
```

3. Boot Appcircle server.

```bash
./ac-self-hosted.sh -n "spacetech" up
```

On complete, refresh your browser and login to Appcircle with your account. You should see that "Connect via SSH" and "Connect via URL" option is disabled on the connection page. :tada:
