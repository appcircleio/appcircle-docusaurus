Upgrading from older versions to v3.18.0 or later, requires `redis` subdomain that should be registered before upgrading. For more details, you can checkout the [DNS Configuration](/docs/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker.md#4-dns-settings) document section.

If are not using the Appcircle server with `HTTPS`, you should also allow the Appcircle runners to connect to Appcircle server from `TCP` `6379` port. For more details, you can checkout the [Network Access](/docs/self-hosted-appcircle/configure-server/integrations-and-access/network-access.md#appcircle-server) requirements between the Appcircle runners and the Appcircle server.

Also you may consider to update the SSL certificate of the Appcircle server if it doesn't cover the `redis` subdomain.
