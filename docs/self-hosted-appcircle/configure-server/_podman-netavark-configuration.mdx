To ensure successful operation of the Appcircle server, it is required to switch from the CNI network stack to Netavark if Podman is bundled with CNI. You can see your network stack by running:

```bash
podman info | grep -i networkBackend
```

You can switch to Netavark network stack by simply installing Netavark and configure podman to use Netavark.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y netavark
```

Once the installation is complete, please follow these steps to configure Podman:

- Add the following content to the [network] section:

```bash
network_backend="netavark"
```

- Save the file.

- Reset Podman:

```bash
podman system reset
```

- Reboot the system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

:::caution
If you skip the step about podman network stack above, you will encounter network related issues. Please make sure you have completed this step.
