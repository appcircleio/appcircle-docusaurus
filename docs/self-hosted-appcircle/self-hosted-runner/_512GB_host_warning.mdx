:::caution
Disk requirement:

If your host machine has a 512GB storage capacity **in total**, please be aware that it won't be sufficient to download and extract the Appcircle runner VM `240918` version and the Xcode images compressed file directly on the host machine. While the extracted VM files will fit within the 512GB capacity, the download and extraction process requires additional temporary space. The recommended solutions are using an external hard drive, external SSD, SMB or NFS.

Open Terminal and use the following command to verify your **total** disk space:

```bash
df -h
```

Please don't forget to change directory to the externally attached disk and run the commands below on that directory.

```bash
cd /path/where/the/external/disk/mounted
```
