##### Up-to-Date Appcircle Runner with Out-of-Date Appcircle Server

If you are installing or upgrading the Appcircle runner from older versions to `1.6.2` or later and using an Appcircle server older than `v3.18.0`, then you must add the two variables below to the `appsettings.json`.

```bash
echo "$(jq '.ASPNETCORE_SEND_BUILD_LOG_TO_REDIS="false"' appsettings.json)" > appsettings.json &&
echo "$(jq '.ASPNETCORE_WORKFLOW_UPDATES_DISABLED.="false"' appsettings.json)" > appsettings.json
```
