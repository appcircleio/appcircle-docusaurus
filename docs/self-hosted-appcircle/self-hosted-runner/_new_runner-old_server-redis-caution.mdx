##### Using an Up-to-Date Runner with an Out-of-Date Server

By default, the latest runner (`1.7.0` or later) is compatible with the Appcircle server `3.18.0` or later. For this reason, if you are installing the latest runner or upgrading the runner from older versions and using an older server, you need to make extra configurations.

To make the Appcircle runner compatible with an older server, you must change the two settings below in the Appcircle runner `appsettings.json`, which will make it compatible with older servers.

```bash
echo "$(jq '.ASPNETCORE_SEND_BUILD_LOG_TO_REDIS="false"' appsettings.json)" > appsettings.json && \
echo "$(jq '.ASPNETCORE_WORKFLOW_UPDATES_DISABLED="false"' appsettings.json)" > appsettings.json
```
