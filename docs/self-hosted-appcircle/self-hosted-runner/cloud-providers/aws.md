## Overview

In this document, you will see how to create an self-hosted Appcircle runner instance on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

We will create a dedicated host, Sonoma macOS EC2 from the base AMI, install the Appcircle runner and make it ready to build Android and iOS applications just like in Appcircle cloud.

## Pre-requirements

### Appcircle Requirements

You can use a self-hosted Appcircle runner for your self-hosted Appcircle server or cloud Appcircle account.

:::warning

The only requirement for using self-hosted runners is to be in `enterprise` plan.

See [pricing](https://appcircle.io/pricing) and feature comparison table for details.

:::

### Technical Requirements

Before creating an Appcircle runner on AWS, there are a couple of things that you need to handle.

#### AWS Account

You must have an active AWS account with appropriate permissions to launch EC2 instances and work with other related services.

#### Understanding of AWS Services

A basic understanding of Amazon Web Services (AWS) services, particularly EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), is beneficial.

You should be familiar with instance creation, networking, security groups, and storage configurations.

##### 1. Networking and Security Configuration

You might need to configure networking aspects such as Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), subnets, route tables, and security groups to properly integrate the instance within the network environment and manage access controls.

##### 2. SSH Key Pairs for Secure Access

You need an SSH key pair to access to the server that you will create securely.

##### 3. MacOS System Configuration

Basic familiarity with macOS system configurations and commands is essential since this document will use macOS commands.

:::info

MacOS is a Unix-like operating system, much like Linux, which means that many of the commands and underlying principles are similar.

If you have experience with Linux, installing the Appcircle runner on macOS should be a seamless process.

:::

##### 4. Dedicated Hosts and MacOS Instances

While the process of creating a macOS EC2 instance on AWS differs slightly from creating a Linux instance, the key distinction lies in the requirement of a dedicated host.

After selecting a macOS image during the instance creation process, users must specify the dedicated host they have previously provisioned, as outlined in the AWS documentation for comprehensive guidance.

Furthermore, detailed instructions are provided below on creating a dedicated Mac instance, ensuring you have the necessary resources for seamless operation.

However, please make sure that you have a dedicated hosts service quota before proceeding to create a dedicated host.

For more details about the AWS macOS EC2 instances, you can refer to the [AWS documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html).

## Creating an Mac Instance for Appcircle Runner

After you meet all the requirements discussed above, you can follow the steps below to create an Appcircle runner.

- Log in to the AWS console with your account.

- Select the region from the right upper corner.

:::info

If you have a self-hosted Appcircle server in AWS, its better to deploy the self-hosted Appcircle runner in the same region as the Appcircle server. This will reduce the latency between two machines.

:::

### Creating a Dedicated Host for MacOS EC2 Instance

#### Check and Request the Dedicated Mac Instance Quota

Before creating the dedicated host instance, you should check the dedicated service quota.

- Head to the "Service Quotas" menu.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws13-dashboard.png' />

- Head to the "AWS services". Filter the services click on the "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)" service.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws14-quotas-dashboard.png' />

- Filter the services by "dedicated mac2" and select the relevant instance type service quota.

  - In this tutorial, we will use "mac2" instance.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws15-dedicated-hosts.png' />

- If this is your first quota request, you can request 1 quota.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws16-request.png' />

#### Create the Dedicated Host

- Head to the EC2 menu to create an dedicated instance.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws1-dashboard.png' />

- Head to the "Dedicated Hosts" menu and click on the "Allocate Dedicated Host" button.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws2-dedicated-host-dashboard.png' />

- Enter an dedicated instance name in the "Name tag" field. For example, "Appcircle Dedicated Host".

- Then you should select the instance family, instance type and the availability zone. For example, "mac2" for the instance family and "mac2.metal" for the instance type.

:::info

You must select one of the "mac2", "mac2-m2" or "mac2-m2pro" instance family types since the Appcircle runner is supported on these family types.

In the [AWS documents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html), you can find the underlying infrastructure.

> EC2 M1 Mac instances (mac2.metal) are built on 2020 Mac mini hardware powered by Apple silicon M1 processors.

> EC2 M2 Mac instances (mac2-m2.metal) are built on 2023 Mac mini hardware powered by Apple silicon M2 processors.

> EC2 M2 Pro Mac instances (mac2-m2pro.metal) are built on 2023 Mac mini hardware powered by Apple silicon M2 Pro processors.

:::

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws3-dedicated-host-launch-1.png' />

- Since the `mac` instances doesn't support "Host maintenance", you should uncheck it and click on the "Allocate" button to create your dedicated host.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws4-dedicated-host-launch-2.png' />

- You can see the created dedicated host on the dedicated hosts dashboards.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws5-dedicated-host-created.png' />

- When you see the state of the dedicated host as "Available", you can continue with creating EC2 instance.

:::info
If you have more than one dedicated hosts, make a note of the dedicated host id to avoid confusion when creating the EC2 instance.
:::

### Creating an EC2 Instance on the Dedicated Host

- Head to the EC2 menu to create an EC2 instance.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws1-dashboard.png' />

- Click on the "Launch Instance" button from the EC2 dashboard.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws6-ec2-dashboard.png' />

You should fill out the required fields as per your needs. Please follow the below steps for a sample instance configuration.

- Enter an instance name in the "Name and Tags" field. For example, "My Appcircle Runner".

- In order to select the AMI, click on the "macOS" button. Select the "macOS Sonoma" from the AMI dropdown menu. And for the architecture, select the "64-bit (Mac-Arm)"

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws7-ec2-ami.png' />

- We will use theÂ `mac2.metal` instance type for our sample configuration since we have crated a `mac2.metal` dedicated host [above](#creating-a-dedicated-host-for-macos-ec2-instance).

:::info
If you have created another type of dedicated host like `mac2-m2.metal` or `mac2-m2pro.metal`, you should choose from the menu.
:::

- Select an existing key pair or click on the "Create new key pair" button if you don't have any on the AWS console.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws8-ec2-type.png' />

- For the network settings:
  - We will use the default VPC created on the form.
  - Don't Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the internet.
    - Appcircle runner doesn't accept any incoming HTTP(S) requests.
  - You can restrict the SSH connection by specifying the source IP addresses.
    - **SSH is also required** to access the server from the command line.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws9-ec2-network.png' />

- For storage, you can select a minimum 300GB disk for a runner that will build android and iOS applications with three xCode versions.
  - For each xCode version you plan to install, add 50GB disk.
  - In this tutorial, we will install the latest three xCode versions at the moment which is `15.3`, `15.2`, `15.1`.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws10-ec2-storage.png' />

- To select the previously created dedicated host, expand the "Advanced details" settings.

  - Set the "Tenancy" to "Dedicated Host".

  - Set the "Target host by" to "Host ID".

  - Set the "Tenancy host ID" to the `dedicated_host_id` of the previously created dedicated host.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws11-ec2-dedicated-instance.png' />

Now you're ready to click on the **Launch Instance** button to create the instance with the configuration you made.

You can head to the EC2 **Instances** page to see if your server is up and running.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-aws12-ec2-ready.png' />

:::info
You need to wait until the `Instance state` of the EC2 instance is "Running" to SSH into the instance.

Generally it takes ~5-10 minutes till the `Instance state` becomes "Running" from "Pending".
:::

## Configuring the Appcircle Runner Instance

### Connect via SSH

After you have successfully created an EC2 instance, you can follow the steps below to connect to it.

- Get the IP address of the instance from EC2 dashboard.

  - Networking > Networking Details > Public IPv4 address
  - Or, Instance > Details > Public IPv4 address

- Locate the SSH key pair, especially the private key, that you've created or used while configuring the instance.

- Get an SSH connection tool like `putty` on Windows or `ssh` on macOS and Linux to connect to the instance.

:::info
The `ssh` command below is for macOS and Linux. The other commands are the same after you connect to the instance.
:::

Using **private key** and **IP address**, you can connect to the instance with SSH as seen below.

```bash
ssh -i "/path/to/your/private/key" ec2-user@ip-address-of-the-instance
```

:::info
The default user for the AWS Sonoma AMI is `ec2-user`. So you should use that `ec2-user` to connect newly created EC2 instance.

So, let's assume that your instance IP address is `34.205.139.17` and your private SSH key path is `/home/spacetech/.ssh/id_rsa`.

You can connect to the instance using the below command on macOS or Linux.

```bash
ssh -i "/home/spacetech/.ssh/id_rsa" ec2-user@34.205.139.17
```

:::

:::tip
When you "Create new key pair" while creating the instance, the downloaded private key might cause a permission error when you try to connect to the instance. For instance;

> ... Permissions 0644 for 'MyCICDSSHKey.pem' are too open.
> It is required that zour private key files are NOT accessible by others.
> This private key will be ignored. ...

In this case, you need to change the permissions of the private key using the below command before connecting.

```bash
chmod 600 "/path/to/your/private/key"
```

It will be a one-time-operation that should be done once per private key.

:::

:::info
The SSH command may ask you to add this server to the list of known hosts. You should write `yes` and hit enter.

<Screenshot url='https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/be-2757-instance-config-ssh-warning.png' />

:::

### Install the Appcircle Runner

#### Install Latest Package

After you successfully connect to the Appcircle runner instance, you can install the Appcircle runner into it.

Change the current working directory to the home directory.

```bash
cd "$HOME"
```

Download the latest self-hosted runner package.

```bash
curl -O -L https://cdn.appcircle.io/self-hosted/runner/appcircle-runner-osx-arm64-1.5.2.zip
```

Extract self-hosted runner package.

```bash
unzip -o -u appcircle-runner-osx-arm64-1.5.2.zip
```

Change directory into extracted `appcircle-runner` folder for following steps.

```bash
cd appcircle-runner
```

#### Register the Runner to the Appcircle server

:::info

By default, the Appcircle runner is configured to connect the Appcircle cloud. If you are not using Appcircle server as self-hosted, you can skip this info.

If you are using self-hosted Appcircle server, edit the `appsettings.json` file with your favorite editor.

```bash
vi appsettings.json
```

You will see the the `ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL` value is pre-defined for Appcircle cloud. Change it to your Appcircle server API domain without changing the path. For example:

```json
{
...
"ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL": "https://api.appcircle.spacetech.com/build/v1"
}
```

:::

Now you should generate a "Runner Access Token" to register this instance to the Appcircle server.

<RegisterAppcircleRunner />

#### Install the Required Build Tools

<ConfigureAppcircleRunner />

For this tutorial, we will install the android tools and iOS tools with latest three stable xCode versions.

```bash
./ac-runner install -o ios,android -x 15.3,15.2,15.1
```

#### Run the Service

<RunAppcircleRunner />
