By default, self-hosted runner package is bundled with configuration for Appcircle-hosted cloud.

:reminder_ribbon: If you're planning to use runner with [self-hosted appcircle](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker) server, you must change `ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL` and `ASPNETCORE_REDIS_STREAM_ENDPOINT` values in `appsettings.json` configuration file before going on.

Please refer to details [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#connecting-runners) for sample configuration change.
