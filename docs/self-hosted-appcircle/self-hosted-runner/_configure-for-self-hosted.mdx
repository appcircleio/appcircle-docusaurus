By default, the self-hosted runner package is bundled with configuration for the Appcircle-hosted cloud.

:reminder_ribbon: If you're planning to use runner with the [self-hosted server](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/installation/docker), you must change `ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL` and `ASPNETCORE_REDIS_STREAM_ENDPOINT` values in `appsettings.json` configuration file before going on.

For Docker installations, please refer to the details [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/linux-package/installation/docker#connecting-runners) for sample configuration changes.
