You need to install some workflow required build tools once before executing any build pipeline.

You can install iOS platform tools, android platform tools or both of them according to your requirements.

Below are some example configurations which shows you some sample runner configuration scenarios:

- Install only iOS platform tools with default Xcode (15.2.x)

```bash
./ac-runner install -o ios
```

:::danger

If your operating system is macOS 11 (Big Sur), then the default selected Xcode version will not be compatible for your system.

Set `-x` argument explicitly with one of the compatible versions. You can select 12.5, 13.0, 13.1 or 13.2 version for Xcode.

:::

- Install only iOS platform tools with Xcode versions 14.3.x and 15.3.x

```bash
./ac-runner install -o ios -x 14.3,15.3
```

- Install only android platform tools

```bash
./ac-runner install -o android
```

- Install both android and iOS platform tools with Xcode version 15.3.x

```bash
./ac-runner install -o ios,android -x 15.3
```

:::caution

While configuring self-hosted runner, platform argument (`-o`) doesn't work as append strategy. Your latest platform argument will be self-hosted runner's **final** platform.

Let's assume, you installed iOS platform tools at first with `-o ios` and then want to add also android platform in order to build both iOS and android apps.

Using `-o android` in this case will be wrong argument. You must use `-o ios,android` for this purpose.
