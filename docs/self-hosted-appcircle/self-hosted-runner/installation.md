# Prerequisites

The following operating systems are supported for the self-hosted runner.

**Linux**

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Debian 11 or later

**MacOS**

- MacOS 11 (Big Sur) or later

The following processor architectures are supported for operating systems.

- `x64` Linux, macOS
- `arm64` macOS only

To install and execute runner, you will need to have root access. Being able to run `sudo` (sudoer) is sufficient for runner operations.

Also you need to have the following tools installed on your system:

- curl
- unzip

These tools are already installed on most operating systems or can be got from default package managers.

Minimum hardware requirements for self-hosted runner can be:

- 100GB or more free disk space
- 2 or more cores CPU (x64, arm64)
- 8 gigabytes (GB) or more RAM

Minimum required disk space should be enough both for iOS and android platforms. But that value is only for one Xcode version. According to your selection of Xcode versions you need more disk space for successful installation.

:::info

For linux installations, you can also prefer docker container for supported distributions. You can install linux package of self-hosted runner on a running docker container same as bare-metals.

**But you must select a docker image with `systemd` support enabled.**

You can either install and configure `systemd` on docker by yourself, or choose from preconfigured images.

See [here](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/04/24/how-to-run-systemd-in-a-container) for more detailed information about `systemd` in a container.

Or, as a quick alternative, you can use docker images from [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jrei/systemd-ubuntu) for `ubuntu` containers.

Let's assume, you selected ready-to-use `ubuntu:20.04` image from there.

First you should start container with command below.

```bash
docker run -d --name systemd-ubuntu --privileged -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro jrei/systemd-ubuntu:20.04
```

Log in to running container with bash, interactively.

```bash
docker exec -it systemd-ubuntu /bin/bash
```

From now on, you will follow same installation steps seen below as other environments.

:::tip

#### macOS VM

Appcircle provides ready-to-use macOS VM image especially for enterprise installations. It can be run on macOS Ventura or Sonoma `arm64` host.

See details in [here](./runner-vm-setup).

## Installation

Adding a self-hosted runner requires that you download, register and configure Appcircle runner in your environment.

### 1. Download

Download the latest self-hosted runner package.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="osx-arm64" label="macOS arm64" default>

```bash
curl -O -L https://cdn.appcircle.io/self-hosted/runner/appcircle-runner-osx-arm64-1.6.0.zip
```

Extract self-hosted runner package.

```bash
unzip -o -u appcircle-runner-osx-arm64-1.6.0.zip
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="osx-x64" label="macOS x64">

```bash
curl -O -L https://cdn.appcircle.io/self-hosted/runner/appcircle-runner-osx-x64-1.6.0.zip
```

Extract self-hosted runner package.

```bash
unzip -o -u appcircle-runner-osx-x64-1.6.0.zip
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="linux-x64" label="Linux x64">

```bash
curl -O -L https://cdn.appcircle.io/self-hosted/runner/appcircle-runner-linux-x64-1.6.0.zip
```

Extract self-hosted runner package.

```bash
unzip -o -u appcircle-runner-linux-x64-1.6.0.zip
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Change directory into extracted `appcircle-runner` folder for following steps.

```bash
cd appcircle-runner
```

:::caution

By default, self-hosted runner package is bundled with configuration for Appcircle-hosted cloud.

:reminder_ribbon: If you're planning to use runner with [self-hosted appcircle](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker) server, you must change `ASPNETCORE_BASE_API_URL` value in `appsettings.json` configuration file before going on.

Please refer to details [here](/self-hosted-appcircle/install-server/docker#connecting-runners) for sample configuration change.

:::

### 2. Register

<RegisterAppcircleRunner />

### 3. Configure

<ConfigureAppcircleRunner />

#### Self-Signed Certificates

If you're using self-signed certificates, you need to follow the below document to add your certificates to runners.

  Self-Signed Certificates
</ContentRef>

### 4. Run Service

<RunAppcircleRunner />

If you need concurrency or multiple instances of self-hosted runner but don't have multiple bare-metals, then you should use virtualization infrastructure.

You can install multiple VMs on a single bare-metal and deploy self-hosted runner to each VM seperately.

:::

:::tip

You can also add or change platform tools after start of runner service.

For example, you configure runner with iOS platform tools using `-o ios` at first, then add android platform tools with `-o ios,android` to build both iOS and android apps.

Install command used for runner configuration, both adds tools to your system and makes some configurations for them. In order to activate changes and updates completely, you should restart runner service after configuration is done successfully.

```bash
./ac-runner service -c restart
```

Restarting runner service will first stop service and start it again.

See [here](./configure-runner/runner-service) for more details about runner service operations.
